Welcome to the first episode of the art-of-the-take we do not screw around with intros or intro music, it takes up too much time takes need more time for takes. I am Spike-Eskin along with ninety four W.I.Ps own Joe-Giglio and Jack-Fritz are you not W.I.P. zone ? No, what are you ? I am of the art-of-the-take okay, that you think this is the most that that in and of itself is a tape. From now on, you'll be known as only spike from the art-of-the-take yes, the ricky what's that now this is my main podcast. Now, this is the podcast i care about the most this's, the podcast that i have teased the most in my life festivities this mohr or the celtics take oh, i've been teasing the celtics take for two months my now that that is not to take that i will release here on this podcast that'll be take that i release on the ricky. I don't actually think, well, it's pretty i mean, you've heard it before, right ? You've heard my celtics take yeah, it's ah pretty strong take, but i'm not going to do it. You sound like one of those guys that gives out the betting lines that we have to call the number i will release this take eight o'clock before kickoff call my number eight, eight, eight hot take and you'll have to give me a credit card number. Teo, to get that take. So we've been talking about this podcast for a long time, you know jack and joe and i often times sit around the W.I.P. offices and it will be before maybe an hour or two before joke goes on the air and it will just be alright. So, like what's your take on, we start start talking about in a very like i'm being honest here. I mean, we're kidding around, but to look to see we're sort of in a take economy right now, right ? Like on twitter, we are judged by our likes are re tweets are replies, sometimes in a negative fashion, but our followers and those are all generated from takes from having a realtor take and i think that we've all talked about the like what makes a take good like what is the result that makes it take good ? What is it that causes that result and just sort of as the more we've talked about, it started to develop an admiration for those who are able to generate just like chef kiss, you know, when you see it, too, you see it take go up and then it's just like, oh, that's it right ? And they're like, they're some i realized, you know, i don't have this on the run down, we have a lot of things we're going to do every week on this and talk about it in a very legitimate way here and what makes you take good, what makes it ? But i don't have this on the run bound, but run down, but i wanted to ask you guys, i think i realized that i was really appreciated takes when i came up with one of my own and and what it's, what opened my eyes, even though i understand in a general sense what maeda take good like i knew it when i saw it, i started to understand the mechanics of it and that's when i came up with my take russell westbrook, our yannis and compose is nothing more than a seven foot russell westbrook, not a winner, and i realized there. Were you going to stop it ? That he's a seven foot russell west westbrook ? Yes. Not a winner put you on the level of truth. Takes me let's. Take renata, take until the final knife. The definitive statement ? Yeah, and because because here's what's interesting. And i had worked on this take for a while because i didn't like i think the honesty's overrated, i think he's good, but he's over and we'll get into how much you have to actually believe it take or whatever. But i do believe that johannes is overrated. Has a lot of potential but is overrated. But i couldn't really express it so stinking about it for a while. And i would talk to andrew sharp about it for a while and it hit me well, he he dominates the ball. He doesn't like he's. Not a good shooter is not a good creator. He's. A lot like russell westbrook, who people think is good, but i actually also think is overrated. So what is he ? Well, it's a seven foot russell westbrook. So that is my my original take is yannis is nothing but a seven foot russell, which is good on itself. Is not great, though, it's not a great take and what i was trying to do, wass and i'll get to the last sentence in the second, the not a winner thing, but what i was trying to do was say when i said nothing but a seven foot russell westbrook that's sort of like the poke like, what do you mean ? Because to a lot of people, a seven foot russell westbrook, a lot of the responses i got when i eventually tweeted it, we're wait a minute that's amazing, a seven foot russell westbrook, but then i slid in there, just really jabbing them in the midsection with he's, not a winner, and i knew that the tweet had really made it that it was a real take when it wound up on N.B.A. eh, like mim instagrams and had thousands of likes a screen grab of my of my tweet and that's when i realized all that could go into just the best day, do you have a moment when you were listening to somebody or read something when you realized man that's really good ? Or is it just sort of been something that has evolved when i was in high school. We're going back to actually not that far. Yeah, it's not really that old i'm only twenty four. So high school for me was last year, not long ago. Ah, sitting it's study hall and i got my friend so worked up to where he tweeted i'm Jack-Fritz i know everything about sport. Yes. And it was at that moment where i was like, i got something here i have i have a weird way of being able to piss people off with my words about sports. You got him, you got him, and then i didn't really turn into a thanks-man i figured till our daily conversations right here for me, it was young and it was by accident. So when i was what great was this ? It was by accident believe every word of it, and sometimes i think it would be great. I wasn't. It was in middle school some point. This was during the full you're trumping the year you're going to four high school. Yeah, i've told you this story before i take at some point during the bulls run was it takes monroe's three during the bulls run, i said to someone most because i was tired of the michael jordan conversation like he just he was annoying to me even when he was great. Like i just was annoyed with michael jordan being everywhere. So i just said to someone, they wouldn't win anything without scottie pippen and, like everyone in class just got so mad at you. Like, what are you talking about ? And i just i realized that give you have if you have a feeling and you push it since someone's gonna get like you could. You know, when you say it, that it's going to be reacted to can you tell the j r smith's the j r smith story ? Because that was a take that pissed off j r smith ? Yes. So i never told no. I never told you this. Wow. So j r smith grew up in the town next to where i grew up. He grew up in lake when i grew up two towns over and he has his school played my school in basketball. We were in school at the same time. Okay, so i think i was a junior and he was a senior. You might be. Wanting a year older than me. Excuse me, but so jared was playing our team, and i am sitting front row heckling j r smith the entire time. And he had the flu and he was having a really bad game. So i was i was feeling good about myself the whole time was i was like, this guy stinks like what's what's all this division one stuff, right ? And then in the second half, he went off, and i mean, he must score like, twenty straight points. And then he came straight up to me and so screaming at me, i was in the front row and i said something to because his brother was also a big recruit at that time. Yeah, and i told that he was the worst of the two smith brothers and then i was thrown out of the arena. Yeah. Listen, the take was off because he turned out to be the better. That doesn't matter, though. Yeah, well, so you know, one of the things that you both brought up was was making someone crazy with the take. And i think, ah, lot of times what people think is is that what ? You have to do is just go in there and say something against what everyone else is saying, and it'll piss people off and that's the tape. But that's not true that the best takes are the ones where half the people actually agree with you and that's. Why, you know when people say, oh, that's ah, hot take it usually means that you've taken an issue that people are are sort of like, you know, there's, a scale of one to one hundred were one you believe the thing on the left and one hundred you believe the thing on the right and people are different, like, like in different spots along that spectrum. But what you have to do is find the thing to say to divide them and push them to one side or the other, and what i say all time about Skip-Bayless is that, you know, is people always think he's full of shit, but the thing about Skip-Bayless is a half of the people agree with Skip-Bayless that's the point you half of the people agree that lebron James even though he's won 3 championships, is sort of not really a clutch player and it not only does it it activate the people who think it and aren't totally willing to say it, but it really tweaks the people who might know it inside, and i don't want to admit it, and i sort of, i think that's why the other day, gabe kapler verse angelo cataldi was so good because both of them said things that each side was like, wait, what's that one saying, like, there were parts of it that both sides could kind of be in the middle on and then those people for when you looked at a tte the ruling, we tweeted out the interview, people were back and forth on who won that thing. I think we have a pull up like, who won ? It was fifty fifty because they both made they both made points they both had takes and kappler said, takes in the wagon interview i don't. What was the quote, jack, the little responsibility to provide the most accurate take that which is taken its of itself. So let me ask you this, um, how much do you have to truly believe the take to go with it now i could construct takes i think we all could construct takes all day long about things that we don't may or may not believe, two that would divide that would be a good take, right ? But i think you do have a responsibility. Maybe skip skip is it is a high level takes man, but i don't think has does not care whether he believes that he's living in his own world, right, that's fine. I respect him. We'll get to him later. I think you sort of have a responsibility. You don't think anything one hundred percent one way or the other for real. But i thank you. My percentages. I have to be sixty five percent of the way there to go it. So really go a sixty or seventy. As long as you truly do. Believes most of it. You could push it, and you could make it more of a thing. Even minds eighty. You have to believe eighty. Yeah. Like, i believe, um, large pardoning believes everything that i put out there. Yes, well, yeah, but that's that's, for sure. I sort of think. Would you be comfortable betting on it and that's ? Sort of my thing in my head, would i be comfortable betting that this is correct and that's what i'm comfortable and this is sort of the crafting like i think you're russell westbrook one applies here than not a winner ? Probably is the thirty percent right, because there's those guys could no idea they could win. Well, wait, here's, okay, let me throw take it. You that didn't i don't even think i planned on doing that. I was thinking about earlier, russell westbrook and jimmy butler actively prevent their teams from winning championships. You cannot win a championship with jimmy butler, russell westbrook, but why butler so much there ? Same thing they they they are not good enough to be the best player on a championship team, but they believe they are, which makes the team unable to be good enough to be a championship team like my position is, is that if jimmy butler was on the warriors, he would think he's the best player on the team, and while some people think, well, everyone should think they're the best player. If you think you're the best player, that also means that you think you should take the most shots and you think you should have the ball the most and you also like he the way he plays it's not just his belief that he's the best player, but he thinks he should be the most dominant player, which makes it impossible for his team to win, because he's not good. Well, it's like the opposite of draymond green who's annoying in his own way, but like he's, not that that's why that works, because he does not any of that in him, right, or at least he's able tto suppress it. So that's my take on on westbrook, but but, yes, i don't know if he honest onto compose is a winner or not, that was in a chilly winds. It'll never be a problem, right ? And chances are he won't win a chance take probably last forever. Yeah, well, most most players don't win the championship, so i will have that forever and i can always point it. It's why the negative take or that this person or this scene will never win ? Take usually holds up better than the other side. That's a good point, because if you are negative, you're right every day, and so you're wrong if you were positive or say someone is what are you wrong every day until you're right ? Positive takes are hard in twenty eighteen, but what i'll say is i don't believe any take is positive or negative, i think if you yeah, if you think positive, if you think it's positive or negative, then it can preclude you from saying from coming out with the good take like i don't think of them as positive or next take has to live organically. It's its own thing ? I think so. I don't think like a player being good or bad is not positive or negative to me, it's, just one thing or the other it's reality ? Yeah, like the false thing marco faults never panning out is is like, i don't think of it as me being negative. I think of it as me figuring out what the odds are because someone always wins when somebody loses too, right ? I mean, on some level there's there's like balance to it. I don't know, but i so what would you say when you say it's ? Hard to be a positive thing about this thing about this ? Ah, gabe kapler is is a top five manager in major league baseball. Now i think you could construe that as a zey. Say positive take and it's also a take. Yes, but it would come off it's too positive. That's what ? It would come in office or like the phillies. I think they're gonna make the playoffs right, you know, and either win the nl east, right ? Positive. But it could be easily proven negative when they lose. Eventually. Jody camera predicted last year that the sixties would win. Make fifty games should break down. That was right, but but he was wrong process of getting to the take was wrong, but but it was still a good take. It was a positive take, he's. Like i don't care. That's what i think that's my take. I don't know. It's a positive take. Um, boy, i feel like we instead of ok. One other thing i wanted to get you before we get into the meat of the podcast. So this part of the pod won't always exist. This this sort of introduction to the art-of-the-take. I think people are getting to know us and like our take process here, right ? Yeah. What's the thought. Behind the take ? Yeah, and i i like takes take awhile for me like they fester euro euro workshop takes man you are a well thought out. All the angles air covered. How can i argue against it ? How can i argue for it takes man whereas me and a gallic village for parks were both high volume jamal crawford level takes me. Wow, did you just put yourself in the same classes ? Espn ? You don't have a take on that. I can guarantee it. And joe yeah shows a deliberate takes man, sees it, takes men that cuts straight to the heart, i think jos, jos evolution as a takes hman over the last eighteen months, i believe it's sort of like, you know how when you're an infant and you're growing as a child, your growth is like exponentially more than when you're like fifteen i'm living this at home, right ? Right, right. I believed shows growth as it takes mean, not that you were an infant before that's not what i think, but you're your taste manship over the last year and a half and on tweets it's, especially like your ranking tweets are always like like like a jab, jab, jab, uppercut. Sort of like the honest ones like they always are. Those work, those air fun, those air it's always fun to rank things, but those kind of takes people react to those. Yes, yeah, people people love lists i love lest they love ranking. Yeah, so one of the other things i want to talk about, i think through the texture of this, doing this every week and by the way, subscribe on apple podcasts or wherever you get your podcast. If just listening to this on omni or on a tweet or something like that, please subscribe and either give five stars or one star there's the on ly two. Well, those air takes yes, and we only have five star ratings and one star ratings. We prefer five star ratings, but but if this is doing the right Job we will only get 5 stars or one star and i hope we get takes in the comments. Yes, we can read takes if you want to leave you describe your best take yes subscribe on apple podcast. Leave your best take and and we'll read some of the things in the pod. Let's take wins that week ? Yes, absolutely. I'm totally down with that. I told jack earlier i called chris ryan from the ringer who was one who was responsible for take hunter, i think, which is sort of our godfather bible in a lot of ways, and i got his voicemail and instead of leaving him a message, i just left him a take and that's what i want to bring back voicemail by just leaving takes, we'll get in the meat of it. I wanted to talk and we don't have to go over a ton of them because i think this will happen organically, but about the different kinds of takes hman and you were sort of going it let that i'm a workshop er i think one of my favorites is Skip-Bayless and my father, howard eskin, are stick to the take move, the goalpost sort of takes man and the best way that you could describe this is the sixers with the process, so he was anti hanky, so his wass they will never you know that this won't ever work, and then they want fifty two games and he's like, well, this won't ever win. A championship, and then if they win a championship, he will be like anybody can win one championship. And then if they won three championships in a row, he'd be like it was bryan colangelo. If you change the equation, you can never truly be wrong, right ? He will always move it and skip is i mean, Skip-Bayless tw of all time at moving the goal posts on lebron James could win the next 5 championships and skip would not bow down to his greatness, and that is well, and the tebow thing, yeah. Oh, yeah, it's. Incredible. He still he still thinks the playoff things a real thing. Of course he does. It's. Amazing. And now, if you've noticed the evolution of skip is that aaron rodgers is his new target ? Yes, he goes after an arduous aaron rodgers. Now, it's. Now you compared him he's, little bron james of the nfl, which is basically not a winner. And when he marries, takes it's it's not like that at work are saying the lebron james of the nfl is basically stealing my honesty. I think he did. Yeah, i mean that's. That's. What he's doing ? He's comparing him to a guy who you think is good by him saying aaron rodgers is just the lebron james of the nfl like that is ah that's a you know the good thing on paper it's a rocky for the style take that's ah that's a movie boxer style take i love the reactionary takes man we get those all the time like that's that's really ? I think the thie average takes hman is every reactionary takes me right right now that the rams look unbeatable like someone would say the rams cannot be be and will not lose a game that's a take and it's just totally reactionary off of what just happened. Jalen mill shouldn't even be on an nfl roster caught him caught him that's take you know you did you have a cut falls take it's more a sarcastic dave like start to believe it. I like sarcastic takes like move the team with the phillies yeah, i just i don't have to hear the takes anymore, right, which is it take in and of itself. All right, so the first thing we're going to dio on this episode of the art-of-the-take is sort of a take report. Card where we'll go over some of the takes of the weak and grade them and sort of dissect them. So the first one this week comes from Skip-Bayless himself. Jack, do you wantto do you want to read us this ? This take ? Yes, yes, so good for lebron playing fifteen minutes in the first half of the first preseason game with all his new teammates after saying he didn't want to play any in the preseason played pretty well, but lakers game of sixty six down by twelve welcome to the west hollywood james wow! So so my the intrigue with this and something that i have noticed that a lot of high level takes men will d'oh is abel craft nicknames for players ? Yeah, i want to discuss the importance of a nickname too a take because he can turn into a hashtag which people can get trending right ? And then you could search the hashtag and see how you're takes doing well, howard with waldo hinky and even ponzi scheme rise a nickname for for the process, one of skips alzheimer's is love fraud, mail fraud ? Yes, and it's cutting you could do it, you could say i you could say something very simple, it's a pretty simple tweet it's just there's not. Look, he is it's a pre but he's c called him hollywood james like it's it's cutting right at the end because hollywood, you think is a good thing, but not when it comes to this. This is how it iss its welcome to the west hollywood jay and you could hear it and i also like good for lebron playing fifteen minutes in the first half of the first preseason game with all this new teammates after saying he didn't want to play any think he's saying, you have he like their little jabs here you have all these new teammates you didn't even want to play in the preseason with, um, good for you for playing fifteen minutes with all of your new teammates. It's already sarcastic and then played pretty well, but they weren't even good like the team wasn't even good and the defense got destroyed. I also appreciate him capitalizing any, which brings his voice tau life in the tweet, but skip is pretty animated and they will go. His voice will rise and fall the any you could. Hear him screaming that i think capitalization makes it takes it takes to the next level because they say i agree with you. They read it in your voice. Yes, they could see you getting animated. Yes, well, speaking of being animated, you know that there's there's like and we'll do this at some point, but there's twitter take there's the radio, take there's the tv take and you're talking about Skip-Bayless shannon sharpe has sort of mastered the bright eyes like wide eyes, giant smile like, totally like, like he's going to explode like it looks like a super hero team she's becoming me. Yeah, it's incredible. So you can always add, i don't think i've ever been a good visual takes men. I think more of my takes our twitter and radio slash podcast i don't i couldn't do what shannon sharpe or and Skip-Bayless i do like how he's like i can't believe i'm going to have to explain this again like that's the look on his face, there's extra art to his takes it's not just what he's saying it's, how he's presenting himself and he acts like he's worn out, explained to take get again i've done this for years. We're doing it again. Lebron still not a winner, not a riddle, have you ? You don't like even as a lebron backer, i think everyone, even the people who say he is the best player of all time, know that even at his best, a little bit he's not quite as good in the clutch like there is a way you could show me all the numbers you want, but there's something about it where i almost feel like everyone who's watching him is hoping he'll make it, but mostly fearing that he won't. That's pretty much been his whole career, and he's made it a lot in the second half. Fisker but the first finals with the heat that basically gave Skip-Bayless material for the rest of his career because that's in that's in the back of our minds forever because that happened, yes. And that was that was like all you need. I mean that. That that that siri's where he basically gave up, you have forever. And he will never live that down. Even though he's been the best player in the league since that moment. Yep. Yep. All right. What's the next one. So next we got stephen. I mean, a consummate takes months, and a former takes men with with stephen, you're with with Skip-Bayless, a former Philadelphia takes me right, and this is a clip talking about, don't you dare come at me and call it bangles a contender, and i just think he checks all the boxes of what you're looking for in a take let's, let's, give it a listen. They have not won a playoff game in a fifteen years that marvin lewis has been a head coach to me, it's, a damn travesty. Man, is a head coach in cincinnati. I'm not saying he doesn't belong to be head coach in the nfl. Max, i'm saying in cincinnati, if you go fifteen years without winning a damn playoff game and you still get to keep your job, utah. Get me started, i don't even want to say what i was tempted to say because it would go too deep and i'm going to die. I don't want to go there, but i'm gonna tell you something right now, and i'm and i'm looking at cincinnati biggest because some of these people call it to my radio show sometime stop, so i don't know how to help this. Cincinnati regal spans outside of cincinnati that's just me, but i think i'll take it. Don't come up to me call the middle column is the grand tweet don't you dare talk to me about the cincinnati biggles being a contender ? You know, when i asked that question and i don't even want you are presenting a damn question to me again. I will never answered that question about the cincinnati bengals onto they win a playoff game. Bank yeah, ends it perfectly. It was a class in session with steven. I have to deliver a tank. He you know he's. It takes him because he's always made me mad it's on ly in the last two or three years when i realized what was going on he said yeah, that it didn't make me mad, he did two things in that that i thought were three things that all note as as high level takes manship first of all, it's a travesty. He's already admitted he doesn't even care about the cincinnati bengals and doesn't think anybody outside of cincinnati cares, but but the fact that a man still has a job who has done nothing has not killed anyone who's not assault, that everyone is a travesty, overstating the importance of what happened, which will get too little or later. One thing number two, he didn't want to cut too deep, he just said it's a travesty that he still has a job on we're talking about a guy who basically blamed ray rice is a girlfriend or wife for getting hit in the elevator, but he doesn't want to hit he doesn't want to cut too deep to marvin lewis like i think cutting deep is something that that that he has no problem doing and the final thing that he does that he does all the time, i think he did it too. Do it to m c w did he threaten m c w or something ? Friend kevin durant. All right, right ? He was like, do not talk to me do not at me and he's being serious, he's like he's, like i don't wantto i am so mad with how badly you're doing your job. I don't want to see you. I don't want to hear you, i don't want to eat, he is cutting everyone off. He is, he is his so sure is take. He is unwilling to hear an argument to the contrary, even though the person sitting right across the desk from him his job is to give him the contrary. Take my favorite parts are the short range and long rains. Ratification would be that short range, the way he screamed cincinnati, you could just see people incense, and i say you're right, not in this town, not here, it sits and the second one is, he said, you cannot come at me until they win a playoff game, which means this take will live for months over there. One of the better teams to start the season if they continue to play while people will keep coming at him, but you're not allowed, so it'd feel like sit there. And it will take will work for months. Yep, at least yeah, at least. And of course, there's the kernel of truth. It is absolutely sort of, like, ridiculous in a sports way that marvin lewis does have a job even though he's never won a place absurd. It's been but fifteen years, sixteen years of some money all and our final take comes from a W.I.P. takes man. Yeah, one of the best of all time an all time takes yes from from angelo cataldi total devastation. That may be the toughest eagles lost ever experienced to money covers to mention it's going to be a long week. And to say that a just for context for somebody not build up, not in Philadelphia that was about their weak for loss to the tennessee titans. Enough time. And this is a team that lost four as a janitor games a super bowl and it was a game. They were only three point or four point favorites like that. They weren't fifteen point right ? But okay, so here's here's. A lot of why this is amazing. Take number one. He is not like howard or skip the he is oftentimes. Grouped in that category, those guys are goalpost movers. Angelo to his credit, if he sees new evidence, will change his opinion immediately. Yeah, he doesn't he's like, but but but isn't that how you know it's ? Funny, like we get punished for not sticking with for for not sticking with takes, but shouldn't you, like, based on the new evidence be like ? Well, maybe is not good, like maybe that guy is good, that i thought wasn't good. Angela will just change. So that is that he is a different sort of takes hman and there was something even though to call it the most painful loss, maybe ever it is is certainly a take one of the best ones. He does hit that thing in your stomach. Where ? Man, that was a brutal fucking loss. And there is nothing interesting about saying man, that was a i don't know that was a pretty bad loss, but they'll be fine like who cares ? Nobody cares about that, but saying that it is one of the v worst of all time is a take the second half of the take. I enjoy a lot too many culprits, dimension and it's. Going to be a long week. Which said that this is the setup because the alley oop that he's going to slam down all week on his show like this is just a tease. Take what it is because it's gonna be a long week for the eagles and a long week for him given his opinions on what happened in that game. It he's already exhausted, he's, exhausted but it's going to be exhausted with him because you feel the same way, right ? The best takes the one that likes to stephen. I did this as well. Skip does us. They all do. It were like it's a chore. Teo, destroy these teams have to tell you again. Why ? Yeah, that finally somebody with a brain is going to tell you what's going on on this operation ? Yes, the best. And you know, i was talking before i mentioned a jack in the hallway wants joe. I think you were there, too. That when i you know, i think we're sitting outside of the studios one day and we were talking about this is when the art-of-the-take was really born at that moment. And i was like, i think about takes the same way i think about, like, music or poetry. I just look at it and i'm like that is brilliant that you found words to say things to rile up half of the of the audience. The other half thinks that you have totally touched on exactly what they're feeling. It is true art. And if i get mad, that means it's he's winning. Yeah, yeah. Sometimes i wonder how takes men if they are just fly by the seat of their pants or they craft the more because, like the angelo, when we talked about, i could see him just typing that out. Yes, well, angelo, i call angelo the peyton manning of sports radio, but i truly think he's the peyton manning of takes men in that he that's it take okay. So peyton manning at a certain point in his career, he was like, angelo is not, like thirty years old anymore, right ? And so paying manny got to a point in his career where, even though he was a vet, he knew where everybody was going to be at every time. And he was able to, like, see things two steps ahead of everybody else. And it allowed him to work so late into his career because he just he knew how everything would work. It was all math to him to angelo is at a point in his career where he is just he knows he just knows the takes. He knows it's. Amazing. I think he said that. That was angela. Just looking at the defense and typing that out. Yeah. First down. Yes. Yeah. First out moved. The chains moved the chains. Where's, howard is more like a brett far or michael vick sort of takes minutes running around throwing it down the field. I look like his career is over. And then same thing he got him back. Yeah. Yeah. Ye yeah. That's. The truth. That is the truth. Hinky was the great thing. That so hey, what is howard's ? Andy reid, which is a perfect parallel. Yes. Perfect. All right, next part. Andi, i hope you guys came with this because we did some preparation. I wanted everyone to give their top-three-takesmen working right now. And if you if you have a top three, um, you can give it if you don't. I certainly have a top three. My top-three-takesmen well, we talked about to write, i think there is a look, i don't want to make it a mount rushmore, but i don't know how you do this without Skip-Bayless, eh, i think they are they're high, i mean, they're the highest level of takes man, but i'm going to throw nick right into a nick wright is kind of all risen up the last couple years. He's an interesting takes because almost like a measured he never gets too excited, but he manages to get everyone really upsetting him like a thoughtful take to me. He's a well actually takes man he's like the he's because, well, actually is the internet, because everyone has access to every piece of statistical analysis and information right at their fingertips, and they're like, you know, kobe was clutch. Well, actually, he wasn't that clutch to me. Nick wright is a new age twenty eighteen style takes men that that understand statistics understands all those and his is going to tell you that that thing that you thought was so is actually not quite and most people see it like, what are you talking about ? This is so and he says it's. Not so. Yep. Colin coward is a high level. Takes me in his ability to piss off the city, yet is unmatched amongst almost anyone else. And he knows it too. He goes too far with philly stuff, and he knows it. But he knows that we're the fan base that would get the most reaction to it and draw the most to his show and they fall for it every time and deep down inside, i believe most of kong coward stakes. Wow. I like colin coward a lot. And i think he's really good. And i believe what he says. The thing i appreciate most about him, he has a way of on air doing what we talked about earlier with your westbrook take. He throws that little thing at the end of a rant or the end of a bird for the end of a segment. Look, what did he just say and it's out there ? And it will become a thing. It's like it's, like a smaller take within the town. I think he does a really good job of making, like, elementary school level. Simple like him comparing wentz and dak to an audie, between like an audience like a chrysler or whatever just simplifies it way down, too, even with its simplified why no, yeah, you have, but that's what i think he's great. So this is how i described colin coward. You've seen the show chopped, right ? We're given a basket of ingredients and you have to make a good dish from the basket of yes, well imagine you're on shopped and you had to make a different dish with the same basket of agreed ingredients for a year straight. Colin cowherd is amazing at taking the same topic and finding a new way into it and a new take about the same thing over and over and over and like callen coward, i think is creative in how and where he goes. I don't think he is like a skip is not nearly as creative. Skip is is meant teo tweak you. I think cowherd is more creative Spike-Eskin so my oh, who else do you have ? Yukon coward anyone else ? We're doing all three right now. We're doing like a will he give all three ? You give nick, right ? Skip and stephen a ok, we'll change it up a little bit my france assa just because, wow, he is a he is a high level case of godfather he's. Some say the sports boat i just love that someone will say something that he definitely said and he'll be like, i never said that. But even though the internet exists now and you can see him saying that he doesn't listen to anyone else it's just him like his takes on lee, they're all his original take. My favorite thing is when he was off the radio and he would guest on bill simmons is pod yes. And bill would ask him one question and then france cecil would just do his show, like, twenty minutes. Yeah, yeah, just he would go from howard. Does that howard's like here's ? What i want to talk about, i'm gonna answer your question, and then i'm going to pivot to what i want to talk about. So france cecil would move onto that princesa is very high level. All right, jack. Last one now not mainstream, but hrh alibaba bulgaria's because for vulgarity, garris yeah, because everything he says, i believe. And then once he says something about my team it's like deep down inside that's true, and i don't want admit that it's true, can i tell you his most upsetting take about one of our teams that he says ? Because i do believe almost everything he says, i know you don't get brett brown is in a good cause, it's terrifying and he he doesn't he's never pointed or mean about it, but he will point out his mistakes and say that there's like sort of no evidence that brett brown is a good coach and that's what he'll say, and he is sure that brett brown is in a good coach and that guy knows basketball. So it's the accurate takes hman that when he cuts your guy you're like, oh, you know, that kind of thanks-man he he is terrifying. Yeah, he's like years ago, you know ? Yeah, its terrifying, terrifying h bob. But but when he said the pill simmons, that are we sure jason tatum hasn't reached his ceiling ? I almost drove off the almost revolver. That was one of the best podcast of all time because he took simmons to task which no one else will and silly comes on the ricky it's he's. Never. Coming he's band one of the scary things for me is her ella bob follows me and i'm scared he's going to see one of my takes and point out how wrong it is like he likes westbrook and he'd likes johannes, and that is i tweet a lot about how much i don't like those guys, so kind of like when you follow me when i followed you like i get nervous when i want a new one, people who like her in the media, follow me. I'm like, scared to tweet. Yeah, and then i just get over. So what point is the accurate takes ? Men become exempt from criticism like you believe them even if you disagree with the museo, they're right. Well, there's, very few of them it's not there not i don't think i like the corral. A bob style takes hman is a like, almost like a real category it's a very small cat should we break down the most accurate takes man in a future episode ? That would be fun to just sort of well, i think didn't yes, but didn't deadspin do that like they just judge predictions or something ? But i would love to talk about accurate takes me, and that would be a good episode at some point. So my top three number three is the guy who jack and all his eagles friends cyber bullied off the internet, can faii the worst. He is the worst. He made a group of people so mad by simply giving his a opinion about a quarterback that they got so angry that a bunch of millennials cyber bullied him off the internet. If you're going tohave chiana fahey on there ? Yeah, brian gets longer, but i'll be on there as well. Get siler whatever his name is, but he's, not brian get cellar isn't nearly as like educated about basketball as can faii, he seemed to be about football. He seemed to know what he was talking. So this is why it's so hard to try to be the accurate takes men because if you're wrong or perceived to be wrong, jackson, his bullies will pull you off the other day when he's sleeping the cyber bullied this guy until he i did it, he did it to himself every time, every time and he fired you get fired from espn that's. What ? That was not our fault. Yeah, but all he did was get drunk once or something. I don't know what i don't, i don't know. I don't even know what he did. I'm very clearly probably have a mild take, and they said, you're gone yet. So he's, my third, mai mai, i i feel like i could do that to you and bartered about, like alshon jeffery. I feel like i could i could drive you guys so crazy that you would drive you. Nbsp both tried to leave the internet. All right, number two, i have Skip-Bayless and i know this is controversial, and i will take full ownership of this, but they're calling to tell me not to give this taste. Wow, the take that's. When you know it's, you that's, when you know the real take the number one takes men in america right now is donald trump. You know, it's hard to argue that that guy ok, so he has a little of i think the phone really is ringing about this. You have not taken that. Probably that look it's a presidential text message i do not agree like i'm not a trump fan. I did not vote for him, but that guy comes out and says the most ridiculous shit. He says it completely sure of himself and half the country believes it. He came, he came out and he was like, i mean, think about a sitting president came out and tweeted three thousand people died in the puerto rico hurricane. I don't know. When i went, it was more like nineteen the fuck is that ? And then millions of people were just like, i don't know, he's got a point, i think it's incredible. You can't do that unless you're it takes man. Yes, that like that, no one else in the world, but it takes one would do that and say, i'm going to just put this out there. He's like this news now fake didn't have a central come and go pill hill site the same news source if it's news that he likes as accurate, but then it's, like see, even the new york times thinks i'm doing your job, and then they put out another stories like more fake news from the new york times he's saying things are fake, like that's what he's, like people believe that it became he took fake news, which was an actual thing, like actual lies meant to deceive people on the internet. And he started calling regular news organizations fake news to them that tuck in press conferences and people believe them, i believe currently trump is the number one takes, but he has the trait that i think if you're going to be a takes men for a living, which he's become the president being insensitive, you have to have and that is you can't care what the reaction is going to be, you know, i think that the bet like the highest level takes men have to have that otherwise, i don't know how they do it like Skip-Bayless doesn't care. No, no don't care. Angela doesn't care well, no, but doesn't care is wrong ? Okay, so here's doesn't care about the reaction doesn't care about the negative part of those past that, you know, they care, right ? It's it's ? Not that they don't it's that the negative reaction the negative side does not faze them is that every time that you split people tto one side or the other, it means half the people are going to come at you hard, and you have to be able to take that. And these guys, they're just like they what it is is they are so sure that half the people do agree with them that that that i think that's where the process cops for by the good yeah, there's like, you know that i think that is the most important part of it is that they, you know, we can do something as normal humans and one hundred people can tell us we did a good Job but if 2 people curses out and tell us we're full of shit, we're going to think about that all night long, they can do it where half it's split half and they're like, fuck it, i got half the people. I mean, that is, i don't know it's it's high levels of different different level, so we've been going for a while here, i feel like we've got to do one of the two last segments, i feel like we got it. Or do you think we can do more homes and that the take a round table ? Or do you you would just go to take a round table ? Should we do a quick mahomes thing ? We could do a quick home saying let's, do it. This is jack, why don't you ? Why don't you leave this one ? Well, mahomes mania is has taken the nation by storm and all the takes men have weighed in on where they feel that the homes and if you criticize pat mahomes right now, you can pull it invalidates the entire opinion because he's playing that unbelievable has been the best quarterback in the nfl, like by far so a constant takes man knows how they should handle mom's made it how far to the continent takes men go. And right now the top-three-takesmen the game, stephen a coward and skip all taking different approaches. Steven, i just pulled the i'm finally a believer card. What you think is a pretty good way to go about it. Yeah, it finally got him. Decide. Okay, is pat mahomes guy may be pretty good Skip-Bayless with a different group, he said he's mia top ten, quarterback of all time, which is just taken it of itself now. That's sort of like the jodi camera before ben simmons had ever played a game before. Joe had ever seen ben simmons ever play basket ball. He said he was a likely hall of famer. That's it longer ? I love long range take because it's gonna be a long time before someone could call up joe and say, joe, you're dead wrong on ben simmons like fifteen whenever he's going to be president by that that's according to his plan and con real, by the way. And colin coward said that he's too thrown aaron rodgers is the best quarterback in the league basically it's a take race, much like the famous moon getting to the moon race in nineteen sixty nine how's the red ? Yes. Okay. And i'd say that takes minute handled stuff. So how was the proper way ? It takes one should handle mahomes mania. So i think because there are so few winners in this because there's on ly one winner, the person who goes the furthest on their homes. I would sort of i don't know if i would partake. You sit out of the hole, sit out of them homes thing or some point or you just you're out of them homes thing until he said i would probably go well, here you could do the homes of our weapons. Yes, but everyone around here, if it feels like they've stayed away from them, a home wins. I don't think anyone wants to say what they really feel about the homes because it might contradict the winds. The marks came on the air one day, and he was like, i would take golf in the homes over once and like it's. It's it's a fair tate sure there that it is a fair take. Yeah, but ah, yeah, i would sit them homes thing out. What would you do ? I think i would pull open the homes of our one steak, you know, just for here, for the for the for the hometown react, but you don't believe it. I believe it. Oh, really ? Yeah. And you're the carson wentz guy. Yeah. I would take my homes if i was starting its in well, no homes is like he's. Got the army. Get the touch he's. Got the legs accurate is he is the perfect embodiment of a quarterback. Wow. So my first mahomes take was i came in with a different angle that he's, the most talented quarterback that andy ever really got to coach. John. See ? Well, i don't think that's yawn because that's a joe take that's a joe take it's like here the three most was this your thes air. The three most talented quarterbacks andy ever coached. Number one mahomes number two. Vic number three. Donovan mcnabb. So really what it was it was done. It got reaction. A donovan donovan people. And i was just trying to prop up my first thought. Was mahomes isr really, really good. Yeah, but you you you really did it. Donovan take disguised as a home thinking that's the best kind of disguising taste within ticks. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, they did a show one day i can. John did a like who is a better eaglesquarterback ? Nick foles or donovan mcnabb like that ? Donovan stuff is easy. It makes it makes like so. It very mad. We played. With them and it was really good. All right, final thing on the podcast every week will be the take a round table where we all bring take or two and we sort of ah, you know, dissect them. Look at them, jack, do you want to go ? Just an idea we should. We should put a poll on twitter saying who won that ? Take our round table. I'm going to take it a lot more seriously. Way. That's. Why we have to do that's why i sprung it in the middle of the yeah, i'm gonna start really workshop ? Yeah, you start work shopping now for next week. Well, then i gotta make sure which take i go with the ow. Um, okay, okay. All right. What jack wanted you go for. So we're going all all three rapid fire we're going to critique to take after it happens. And then why don't we ? All three do that takes and then we'll talk about it. Okay ? Okay. But how many takes one. Take one. Take the take of the weak. Could take a week to pick from your list. And we all have a pretty substantial thanks-man throughout today. We really, really do all right. There's absolutely no reason to drive a stick shift. I can't believe that i drive stick shift. Yeah, well, i enjoy it, there's no reason. Okay, way. We're not supposed to. Okay, you khun, you can back up your take if you wantto firing there's. Absolutely no reason to drive stick shift manual is is perfect. And you don't have to touch it all, it's. Just like i don't see absolutely any reason to have to be the guy the drive stick shift and plus i think the people that drive stick shifts figure themselves better humans than others home that's never going to be a winner. Okay, all right, i got it. Am i up ? Yeah. Why don't you go ? Championships are the most overrated thing in sports. They have ruined the discussion about sports and ruined out. Anything we try to say about a player always comes back to the rings argument and it's it's warped the way we talk about these things wouldn't be the hall of fame or just individual players. You cannot have a legitimate conversation, but nick foles ever again because of the super bowl, he will forever live in lauren the city regardless of what kind of quarterback he is, nick foles his championship and any championship ruins the discussion about players. Wow championships. Worst thing about sports good take all right, here's mine. I'm gonna go with my full stake next season. Nick foles is more likely to be retired from football than starting for an nfl team. I don't think nick foles wants any part of the pressure work of starting for an nfl team. I don't think he wanted it in the first place. I think any quarterback who thinks about retiring seriously is probably not a starting level quarterback in the nfl. You could never tell me that a guy like aaron rodgers or or any peyton manning or who played until they were they were, you know, rotting that they would ever pass up a chance to play. He passed up a chance to start when he told the eagles not to trade him, so i think there will not be a situation that is satisfactory enough and comfortable for him enough, and if his two choices were to start or retire, i believe he would retire. I take it. I mean, i agree. Okay. All right. So i have no rebuttal, so you're her. Your stick shift take made me mad because you drive us because i enjoy driving a stick shift. Now speaking, i think it's here's why, i think it's a good take. It made me mad and it is very like, like one note. You're an idiot if basically, there's no reason for this where i would critique the take is very few people drive stick shift at this point. Like it's. Almost impossible to find a new car that is stick shift so i don't feel like there is a mass appeal to the thing. Well, i don't know. Fifty. I don't think that i don't feel like it's a fifty fifty thing now i do feel like it is smug and it's the people that it hits very hard which hit my side my smug takes yes, you're one of the most smug you talk about your own brand all the time but you do it in it like a smile on your face so it's, like i see you giving takes i know it's not really smug but you come off as a smug takes your smug that's why i agree with your stick shift one like i don't know why we're still doing this, so yeah, it makes sense. Okay, here's, why now i gotta defend myself. I feel like i have better control over the car in bad weather. And i also like something to do while i'm driving. That keeps me away from being distracted. I think driving is boring. I have, like a forty five minute, traffic filled drive to work and it makes it less boring to me. I feel like i'm a race car driver. See that's what it is, it's the last thing you want to be a race car driver. I do are driving gloves and i don't i don't want driving gloves. So, joe, steak championships ruin sports. I think you would find surprising support for it. It might not be fifty fifty. But i do believe it would at least be sixty. Forty. It is the entire point of sports to win championship and that's. The problem. Yes. So it is flaming, i think it's a good take. Ah, i think it's such a good take that it drove kevin durant insane wow, it did dr kevin durant and saying because it's all it's on ly reason you want to go on staying like this is our fault. Kevin durant in golden state is our fault it's the media's fault can i tell you ? My kevin durant take while we're on it ? I think i've mentioned the state, i believe that the only way that kevin durant can successfully turn this narrative positively, everyone says he's got to go get his own team. Is he has to stay for the at the war on the words for the next decade ? He cannot longer than everybody else. He has to wait for everyone else to leave. He has to be the most dedicated to the warriors. Not only that, i believe he has to force dream on green off the team. I think if kevin durant forces draymond green off the team, thereby making the warriors worse while he stays, he gets the kobe people in he and creates a positive ego narrative for himself. But that's the only way, if he goes to the knicks, it doesn't work, then he just looks like everyone who said he shouldn't go to. The warriors won. Yes. Like now he has to beat everyone who said he should go to the war. Whose shouldn't go the words by staying there longer than he was fifty years from now. Someone's looking at basketball reference. They have to say that was kevin durant's team for a decade. Right ? Not gonna happen. Can i give a dream on green ? Take sure the next contract. Whoever gets in the next contract, it'll be the worst contract in basketball. I completely agree. I don't even think we closed. No and he's going to go somewhere where he's going to have a little bit of jimmy he's gonna want to prove that he can score some points and he's not sounds like he will go to a bad team next. Yeah. Yeah, i think so. Just to get a max ? I think so. Um, and then there's my take. What do you got ? Well, you agree with it ? Yeah, i agree with that. Because, like he's already concede already considering his life after football, he's watched like this often. You don't write a book talking about overcoming the odds and how you made it and then come back and play with the same competitive fire, the way he wrote the book with the with the sub headline of overcoming the odds and all this stuff doesn't scream to me like a guy, it seems to make a guy has already made its finish line talk status, finish line, and i think it was already proven once because he left here. He left his comfort zone and he fell apart and everyone likes to blame everyone else for nick's failures away from Philadelphia no one likes to blame. Maybe nick wasn't ready for it, right didn't want it, and i think i think it works because there's a lot of people that still believe and nick false, i think you have to tweak those people. I believe those people have. I have stood the test of time, but they look like winners right now. Yes, well, he did win the super series a statue outside the stadium. He is a super bowl m v p that i just said would rather retire than start, so i can't believe there's a statue, but that won't last forever, right ? That's just up for the season or something. Is that hope otherwise, carson's going to live in his shadow forever. Oh, my god! Can you imagine that this is statue of another quarterback outside that here's, another taste idea ? While we're just throw this in toward the end, we've been going for almost an hour and i feel like we could go for another hour. Carson wentz would've rather the eagles didn't win the super bowl totally agree. You see the way you handle himself in the face during the play offs like he was happy, but not really. I saw a video from crying in the locker room like his head down that i didn't really i didn't see it before until, like a week ago this that was just down, buried, upset, there's no way they wanted he wanted to win that game, he wanted to be the guy, right ? And now he'll he'll never win the first eagle super bowl, and he has to win multiple to beat nick mortals. Yeah, a lot of tough road a ho for a guy who's, twenty six in the league and accuracy, not this year in two games, i don't care, i don't care. He was sixty six percent and seventy thiss has been the art-of-the-take Jack-Fritz Joe-Giglio myself Spike-Eskin we're going to start having guests on art-of-the-take again, we would love your take in your apple podcast review.
