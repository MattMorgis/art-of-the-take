Welcome to the art-of-the-take you might be used to podcast opening up with intros or music, but we don't do that. We don't want to waste any time. We want more time for takes. This is the second episode of the r to take the first one was one of the hottest things on the internet. We we expect that this one will be even hotter. I'm Spike-Eskin along with W.I.Ps evening host Joe-Giglio hi, joe. Hi, spike and, of course, the evening show producer and go birds podcast host that is Jack-Fritz somehow worked his way on this, but here we are takes man, you act like that. Is you moving up in the world with some some fashion ? So jack came here to be on it. Takes in podcast. Yeah, he's reached his. This was his only. This is why he got hired. So the art-of-the-take is a podcast four takes men by takes men. It is a place where we can discuss takes sports opinions in a place where you will not be judged. If you're wrong, we like to really drill down it's called the art-of-the-take we like to look at the take. Why it's a. Good take. Why it's a bad take. Celebrate some of the best takes of the week on today's art-of-the-take we will have some takes from our itunes reviews. Thank you. Please leave us either five stars or one star. Nothing in between. We had fifty five star reviews, i believe ten one star reviews there were two people that left us three star reviews. Please do not leave this three story star reviews are mild takes lessons and then which is not even to take. Yep, yep that's it but it's not even to take it all it's a james seltzer asked, do not we'll get to that in a minute we will go through our take report card will play some of the takes of the week and and sort of grade them are takes manpower rankings who we all think are the three top takes men of the weak who had a good week wake and takes of course. And i say, of course, but we have to really drill down on Peter-Gammons week and takes Peter-Gammons as it takes hman was not something that i think any of us saw coming. It's a late career pivot for peter right. I just appreciate that we already have Peter-Gammons listening to the broadcast. Yep. Yep. Saw what we were doing and mark cuban because he hired her al bab the day after we did this, but i think he hired him the same day. I think it was the same day that night. Think about the cloud. There's, gammons and cuban both listen to the art-of-the-take daddy, when you know you've made it, everyone listens to be art-of-the-take it is the takes mons podcast. And then, of course, at the end, we will do the take round table where we all give a lojack. Do we have to do two takes each suggested, and i like the idea of having a non sports take and a sports take because i think i must have more non non sports. So when it comes to well, your stick shift take less. We took off, you know, like the sixteenth take. Well, then ford introduced a truck that had seven gear. We're even influencing. We're even in this fort is listening to this thing is really taking everyone's had take smith. All right, so here's, what i want to start with and you know, i expected to start the podcast with this without even an intro, but then yesterday's events really show you how important it is and two things a to get your take out there when you have when you have it, and then be how quickly take can age and which is why that and we'll talk about this. Why, i think, you know, old takes aren't something that you should be held against you. So my thing i was going to open up the pod and i was going to go Gritty is over it's over, i think Gritty is done. It was like it was trash Gritty was trashed for two hours Gritty was the talk of the town for two weeks and much like a mean, much like a you know any mean that that has a seventy two hour life cycle. I was like, Gritty is done graze over. But then all of a sudden yesterday Gritty became a ah tool of the left. Yes, which i didn't see. Come now. What happened here ? What did i miss ? When, when something becomes too mainstream and Gritty became so overwhelmingly popular there is eventually going to be backlash to the open america and its core is a negative place where eventually bad things happen and Gritty was so overwhelmingly loved eventually people will get tired of it and what that becomes and it's interesting. You say that so Gritty went from university. Lee, one of my favorite part of the podcast is watching both of you because you get these twinges of realizing how ridiculous it is, and then you settle back, i have to work through that. Yeah, yes. So, like, i done listening to what you're saying and i thought i'd try the lab, right ? We have a lot of fans, a lot of fans. So ? So what happens with Gritty ? Is it Gritty goes from two hours of everyone's like what's this then everyone loves Gritty and if everybody loves something, you can't really have a take because the ideal take splits the audience right. Half the people agree with you half the people don't agree with you. If everyone is on the Gritty train, you can't have ah Gritty you can't have a take on Gritty but then the Gritty backlash sort of came and he's like they found his old read. History ? Yes, which is what i was waiting for was, i imagine is pretty bad. Yeah, like who is the fat guy ? The fat guy in the red sweater who was on the debate that well, and it was something about ken bone N.B.A. you know, if you go back and everyone's timeline long enough, we were on sexy, pregnant lady read it, all of us were, you know, he was there a lot Gritty was definitely there are a lot. So the backlash yesterday so what ? What happens ? We had one from what was from glen back now. What ? There was an article, right ? Wasn't there an article in the new yorker in the new yorker, the abg saying that Gritty was a tool of the left, the left one, the war for Gritty, right, which was never that crazy. Yeah, so it's not a way to politicize Gritty which i didn't see coming. No, i didn't see the big you get that you invite that, chris, wouldn't you like ? I've lived here a long time Gritty to me is the part of delaware county that votes republican, even though they don't make a lot of money, i would. Have never guessed when Gritty became political that he'd be a tool of the left like that that came out of nowhere to me Gritty was like, not drexel held Gritty was s sington or ridley or something that was said that's what Gritty was to me, he certainly wasn't a tool, the lights because it because he went on the tonight show that he became i don't know, i never see outrage about him going on a bar stool that's where i think it originally might have started. Oh, and is that where the fight for Gritty began or what it was like, it was like, all great things have to come to an end. Kind of right. So what was glenn so so glenn's date now ? W.I.P. hada takeable actually before the show tonight i talk to glenn about his take on that. You have an exclusive ? Yeah. Do you have a quote ? Yes, i give the takeable i'll report for glenn. Thank you. Sometimes you have to stand alone. I think Gritty is a cheesy marketing tool. A cheap knockoff of the fanatic. Forty years later and unworthy of what ? The Flyers what's wars. An organization. So sue me! Wow! So soon mi's glenn became it takes men there. Let's. Say right there that's a friggin take i mean that's a great take. I don't i don't know even know if i agree with it, but it's a take the funniest part to me about the take itself is that it's unfitting for an organization whose most famous oh, who's the most successful era was when they beat the crap out of everybody so much that they want. But league was Gritty in the staties. Yeah, but but Gritty is not befitting of the honor of being a Flyers. Glenn told me before we recorded today he's not backing down from this he's. Going to go further. I respect religious and i guess it shows this weekend are coming up after we record this and then his c writes a column. So he's, this is the war with glenn verse Gritty has just begun. Is glenn closer so glenn as a sort of guy that would bemoan the success of somebody like Skip-Bayless a one of our amount rushmore takes men forced one of the best. But in some way he's like the upside down version of Skip-Bayless tries to be the righteous takes me. Yes, but whoever he believes, his righteous there it is righteous takes men we had never Jack-Fritz we just came up with a new kind of takes men and you're buried in your frying not buried in my phone given takes clan had another take earlier this week. I just think i think glenn had a good week. I think he had a good week. Takes wow. So i was looking for it. Okay, what is it ? Ah, so is on his metro column through the excerpt from its breeds. No player epitomizes that current ineptitude like jalen mills, the neon haired corner who combines incompetence with an obnoxiousness that there's the press to throw a taunting flag. Yeah, boom! The neon heritage makes that. Yeah, i just think glenn had a great week. Great week is it takes man. Well, then there was i don't want to get too much into it, but and because i couldn't tell if she was talking about the article itself. But that was sarah baker who used to work here. Said that Gritty was a tool of the left, and then she seemed to be upset that takes back to her ? Yeah, i she she gave a take on a take. I got i have takes on her and i don't wanna so why don't we go to the itunes review takes so we want you to leave takes in the reviews on apple podcasts or itunes wherever you listen your podcast give us five stars or one star leave your take. We will read some of the better takes and maybe discuss them. This one gives us five stars. This comes from wankel easy, the subject on his greek freakishly average take, which is a great way to start way we talked about the importance of nicknames. Yes, i agree with spike that johannes is overrated, but i think it's for a different reason. People think johannes is such a great player because of his name it's cool, it's exotic, but is he not ? Especially if his name were something average like eric smith and he'd be just another above average N.B.A. player. But since he has a cool name and a rhyming nickname, he gets thrown into m v p conversations. Eric smith wouldn't be considered an m v p contender when he leads his team to a seven seed in the terrible east. Is it's a great act ? Great. Is it also the reason that joe smith was never a good N.B.A. player, we're in it a part of it part of it was he wasn't that good ? Yeah, yeah, but our is basically what you're saying that the johannes is basically the same players ? Joe smith it's just he has a cooler name much high, much bigger height for this guy, but they're the same guy. This one comes from fed yanan five stars nice takes the sixers cannot win a championship with joel embiid as one of their top two players. He gets played off the court by the celtics and warriors every time they play dreamin and al horford will live in his head perpetually. Now this is a good day in perpetuity. This is the good take because it made me mad britain but it also hit something deep down inside of me that you sort of think you sort of think it's true, because when i watch him, i have never really been upset watching joel embiid, but i get upset when he shoots as made threes. Is he does okay and the turnovers and i just there's a part of me that wonders about him in a big city, and he did look she's mentally broken towards the end of the celtics here, like he was just frustrated that loves that, though he loved being mentally no, no, no, but he loves, like he loves feeding into the crowd thing, right ? But it doesn't get too high and too low that worries me. I love this state because the end, the in perpetuity like it's, like this will always speak it. Really no one does it make you worry ? Makes you worry that he can't change it like this is his destiny. You know, jack does talk a lot about, you know, some of the best takes being ones that you sort of believe in your gut, but you don't want to say out loud, and then somebody says it and it's, you know, it's crushing like the lebron thing we brought up last week about him in the big moment. Yeah, like you believe that he's kind of a choker and you want him to make the shop, but i think it might not go. In and then you think about how you're gonna have to defend them. That's what i do ? Yeah. It's maur yes, that's. Exactly what happens and and the facts are on your side. But the problem is the other side of the take, like they're probably right and is in some way. And there they have a visceral reaction to what just happened. And then finally, this comes from the sioux, bro subject line better than anything these guys have done before. Is that a compliment ? Take it is a backhanded confidence. The next Philadelphia sports team to win a championship will be the phillies. And when it happens, no one will really care about it's. An amazing ending to the first part of it. That's a taken itself because right now and no one would say that, yeah, but the second part is like, yeah, this is gonna happen, and no one cares what you care. Doesn't even matter. Yeah, i mean, it's batic. Oh, is it back ? Take it hurts now, it's. Like, of course, before going to care if they won the world series. The philip phillies parade was more hype than the eagles parade. That's another take well, how many people were at the eagles parade compared to the phillies, we don't know the numbers rouleau off. It depends on how, if you ask coward, you're not my father. There were a million good to take that, yeah, all right, so thank you. Please leave your takes in the itunes reviews, please. Five stars or one star, five stars or one star it's. Time now for the take report card. Let's, go through some of the better takes of the week. First one we're going to talk about came from a former W.I.P. host, a former eagle former cowboy eagles reporter known as g cobb. Let's. Hear the take. I think that i would go to drastic measures. I think they need to go on a fast, so what kind of fast, not food ? Fast. The boys need to be cut off from where, from. No, make a difference. You think that's the best we have hidden too much. Well, that's what ? But bob's up your mind you rule you're not supposed to do like before. Hold on nineteen fifty five call they want it is wow! So that is g cob on fox twenty nine his take being that the eagles to get back on track need to have less sex. Here's what i love about the take the showmanship by ci cobb that they will pregnant pause there where he knew he had something he knew he had the room and he was going to just milk it it's almost like if you're tweeting it, you could break up the same. Taken to multiple tweets like your extend this one out or just the showmanship there that's anti level and it's. I gotta get it given credit because this is i was thinking about what kind of take this is. This is to your point a showman's. Take it's an entertainment taste because it's not really splitting any audience, nobody you're either laughing or you're going ok there there's there's no fight that's going to is no one saying yeah, he's definitely right. And someone's. Like, no way, jakob that's. Ridiculous. Yeah. I would almost think that a lack of sex would cloud your mind more than actually having sex, but i don't know. Well, six costanza, it is the costanza just big on the seinfeld rest references. Well, george got working sports radio. That that's what you have to do now ? Only some shows. Ahh! All right. The next one came from mount rushmore takes hman. And that isthe Skip-Bayless ous soon as he did this, i believe i sent this to both of you. I'll i feel like it's some point. Wouldn't it be cool every time we released one of these pods toe also release the weak in our techs. Shame and just put the images because there's an art-of-the-take text threat. Yes. No, i don't. I wanted to be ah, take space as a xjak way coin that now ? Yeah. You basically explaining to the beginning, right, without saying what it is. So, you know, this podcast we always were goingto have takes and there's going to be reaction to those takes because that's what a great take does! And we just want the listeners podcast the people who care about podcast to understand that this is all take space, a safe space for takes her takes you we're not gonna we're only going to judge you on the quality of your take, not the accuracy of your take and that's. Why there's an art to this whole thing ? That's the whole point of this podcast, right ? And we're really we're workshopping the take all week long in a text threat, right ? Yes, there are. There are takes that happened in attacks that we burn. I almost don't want to give takes in the energy threat anymore. So are you saying that we should we should release the link, but them have four pictures of the best takes in the frontex. Yes. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I really think this is an inside look at how much work we're putting into the spot that it's a lot of wear. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Well, i mean to this guys that point it's better than anything that these guys have done before these guys working harder on this than that. Also not a bad point. Alright, Skip-Bayless so i sent this one after the eagles lose the Philadelphia egos or two and three time for foles and that pissed me off about that steak. Some jack was so mad at this time hated it. Is that like it's so simple and there's ? No thought process behind it. And it comes from not watching the game, probably. And it just like it's just it's. So oversimplified that like, ah, i took a step back after i have my initial outrage Skip-Bayless Skip-Bayless here's what it is i don't know if he watched it on. I've given credit say, prime watch it was in his drafts before the game starts. Oh, yeah, come on, he's got a year's worth of takes and his drafts look, you know, to skips credit, i always say if someone talks about a watching the games or be cursing, you've won with the take and jack just describing this going Skip-Bayless didn't even watch the game, skip, he won. He the jack probably cursed when he first saw you. I knew he was in the second. I was outraged. What was this ? Will cain, rogan. I have audio, but okay, i'm excited. Yeah. It's it's a good one. It's. Pretty fine what's this from so it's from from first day from first day in the dak zeke era, they have gone for it on fourth and one nineteen times. They made it eighteen times that's ninety four percent. What in god's good name terrified you at the opponent's forty two. What are you doing hunting at the opponent's forty two in overtime with a chance to win the game ? What more ? This is what you've invested in for going on a decade. You chose tyron smith as our friend rex ryan. Just point out to me in the green room. You chose tyron smith over j j watt. I like it. That's fine, but that's how you chose to invest you chose zach smith over johnny manziel. Thank god, but that's how you chose to invest you chose a sickle, elliot over jalen ramsey. I still don't hate it, but you've invested for close to a decade and being able to run on fourth and one, and you punish me because you're a loser. I was laying for it. That was the hammer taker. It's like just the sledgehammer. Because you're a loser. You know, the whole time i was like, this is all fine and he's probably right. But where's that's like what's the take here ? Well, i mean it. It hit. It really does point a little bit too. When i named last week when i named trump as the number one takes man that's a trumpian sort of move like you black that your loser your old loser exclamation point on the end, loser! Yeah! Wow! I just thought the set up was great. Yeah, he had. Everyone is waiting. Where was the knockout punch ? Right ? Your loser and losers. A very strong term. Take in take spaces and finally not yet another Skip-Bayless now this i was i was sitting through takes this morning on skips timeline and i came across this one and i tell you what it is a god damn masterpiece. Eyes is it is what you're striving for as a takes hman. Let's, let's, listen in. Okay ? What happened at the end of the half ? He went on a little bit of a scoring. Fleury he scored seven points in the last two minutes of the first half to climb to fifteen total for the first half with ten rebounds. He also had five assists, one turnover, one turnover, but he had fifteen points because he did make the walk off three and it was a bomb. Three it's. Kind of like a set shot. Mom hit it from reed or cars and see what he did. Did it win the game now ? Oh, no. Is it was a walk off at the weigh in. Oh, and it did give him a four point waits that wouldn't like we gotta have this shot to lead a way. But it was impressive and he held the pose and he struck did. But it was great. It was great. And it is set up in there. It was great. I give you all that. But here's, what was funny about that sequence ? Meanwhile, in the shadows, there was this guy on golden state. I forget what his name is. But guess what ? He added half time. This guy for gold state had eighteen points and ten rebounds at half time. His name is i forget you're doing it right. Doing it like always always. Kevin durant. Remember that guy ? The guy who plays for golden state ? Remember that guy ? He had eighteen and ten at halftime to lebron's fifteen and ten. But the narrative at halftime, the narrative on espn rightfully so was lebron is putting on the show of shows in vegas, right ? Yeah, they were ok. So he was you once again, the best player on the planet was showing you quietly that he's still the best player on the planet. His name is kevin durant. Wow. So there are a lot there's a lot in their first of all. Doesn't skip sound a little bit like the church lady from saturday night live ? I might be snowing myself with you. Got he does think mohr lately ? Yeah, like he's moving towards becoming that woman. I love him. You're weaving how the preseason doesn't matter, but when you've scored three more points and a half, it does matter, right ? Yeah. That's a commitment to the take or i'm gonna bury lebron no matter what i have to do here is skips lebron take thread the greatest take threat of all time he there's no better goalpost changer no now he's using like he he stooped, he stupid to the preseason, which is crazy it's like watching barry sanders run where it looks crazy and then he's in the end zone at the end and i just i just i just couldn't get over the well it didn't count to win the game. It was only half time that doesn't count it's a bloodshot and only put him up for you to say, i think shannon sharpe has made Skip-Bayless thumb and he just throws things back. I think it just motivates skip to just go one step further. Well, it's, sort of like skip, you know, skip that divorced and now has a new girlfriend that is making him dress cooler. You know, like all of a sudden he's going to the gym. He's eating better. He's dressing Skip-Bayless shannon is like, what's that movie with the guy from the office where he meets ryan gosling and he makes him cool. Who's michael from the office. It's ah it's steve carell still corral. What is that movie ? I know what you're talking about. Um, forget it's. Ah, something love kind of something. Yeah, whatever it is, i'll look it up. So just to wrap up the take report card because these have all been a level takes i wanted to bring up a take from someone here at sports radio ninety. Four W.I.P. he is the midday show producer. Crazy, stupid love crazy, stupid love. He is the midday show producer. He is also a host of the gobert's podcast. He is a you know, a friend of ours. James seltzer and james had what i would go so far as to say is the worst take of the week. It was a thirsty i want i want likes take it wasn't even a rial take i would like, wait, i'm trying to find it. Where is it ? It's ? One of the worst takes i've ever read ah, wow. Yeah, it was horrible. Wasn't gonna take it was really pathetic. Where did he delete it ? Because i made fun of it. Here it is. By the way. Five thousand two hundred likes seven hundred twenty two returns. We'll recall those people. Sheep ? Yeah. They're idiots feel bad for j j contract year and dude was trying to gut it out with a broken back. Rough stuff. Thanks for the super bowl. J will always love you in philly. Okay. It's. A love letter let's. Call it what it is. It is a love letter to j j. I change. I was the third best running back on the eagles in the super bowl. Full stop. Jojo was not playing with a broken back. Can we just man up for a second ? And like, if you have a broken back, then you're in the hospital ? Yes, he maybe had a fracture in one of his vertebrate or something, but he did not have a broken back and he was trying to tough it out so he could make more money next year. Not for the team is like j. J will always remember you and Philadelphia he's. Not like pete in ca v lia or something. How many games they play for the eagles ? Twelve, ten. Ten. It had to be right. First game was like last late october or november. And he's gone over to the head of a november. It will always remain love you and fear. Come on. I mean, like we remember him, but it's not like, i mean, he was important, but it's not like i was like, man j j legend. I think the worst part is rough stuff stuff something that rough stuff just rubs me the wrong way. They're like like he's really like this is it's, really unfortunate what happened ? Surprise, surprise, james seltzer, even show up to work the next day. Well, i i i skewered him because he's so broken up about i got a little i get a little i was a little later toe work that day, and instead of going into the midday show meeting, i sat down. You know, just for a few minutes, we bat around a few things, and as i'm walking out, i go seltzer, that tweet sucked, i just level them, he deserved to be leveled, and the camera went right in on him. He goes broken back, and i'm like here's. The other thing that seltzer does here, i hate when people skip. Feel bad for j j i like you're saying i feel bad for j j i like come on, man like it's so dramatic he should delete this tweet they might have to after the reaction to this kid you from this podcast ? You guys agree ? I agree and he won't, because i'm gonna take a screenshot won't because of all the lights and retweets, you should put it on art-of-the-take bod and so i should james salter really forced to really does have sweet follow some twitter at art-of-the-take pod i i would suggest until he deletes the tweet you should unfollowed him. Wow! That's bold! I'm blocking him right now. I had the block i almost blocked jota day. Why in sex messages ? Why ? What was he talking about giving that he's given once take it because i was just giving one's truth which can not handle was giving what unsolicited went slander i i didn't see coming alright top-three-takesmen of the week, right ? Ah, jack, why don't you give your top-three-takesmen of the week ? Okay, so i'm going to keep francis on their on ly because after they lost, he said they don't need man the chatter. Of bryce harper, they need daniel murphy, which is amazing. It's a huge take, yep. And king stay kings i i love left. Mike Skip-Bayless skipped out a great week really there's no reason to move him off of my power rankings and really this morning help solidify that with the fantastic reaction to lebron's preseason game. Yeah, thie, golden state warriors and coming in the power rankings, i don't know how we can keep Peter-Gammons ofthe way haven't talked about pete yet, but pete went from established legendary hall of fame journalists into a takes man over. Yeah, yeah, fire takes i mean, he went from zero to sixty faster than anyone i've ever seen in this. And does this force raided ? Injured to turn into it takes it's a good it's a good calm prey is kind of our local football version of Peter-Gammons i would love to see ray that takes ray going after all the citizens of philadelphia. Now, that would be something i know somebody who doesn't rate didn't your impression i should we should get ray the takes men on the pod next week, right ? Cem takes out for really didn't yeah, roy didn't. Sure, that takes mom, so actually have the same power rankings as jack written down here. I want to throw an extra france sa nugget in there. So he tweeted the night before the american league wild card game last week that the yankees should not start gary sanchez, who was having defensive issues catching p and home runs later in the next round, and he tweeted, this is why you don't bury gary sanchez. He doesn't care, he has no memory, doesn't matter. Yeah, it's like it was a quitter version of i never said that, which is like a staple of his show love it the one guy who's off of my list for reasons is is stephen a ? Because i think stephen a had a mild take weak and i was looking i was looking at all those tweets i was watching first take i think he had a bad week. What about his his take that he would never go to the beach with a man ? Did you hear that takes way were so to talk about i saw that you're sure i'm sure bring it up. Um, it wasn't it was a take it wasn't. Really ? Well, well, listen to i didn't think it was a radio show was just a back and forth hey didn't prepare that take it just that's just what he feels. I just thought it a bad week. He had a mild celtics warriors take it was it was a mild weak from steven steven issue never get past by Peter-Gammons saying he's gotta steps. Go my top-three-takesmen of the week number two is jimmy butler. Ah, wow! The nerve to go to timberwolves practice screaming the general manager. You need me ? Just days after demanding a trade and not going tio not going to practice at all. Going to camp it all is an enormous take. I think taking the the third string team and beating the first string team is sort of like an athletic take almost. I'm better than you. Yeah, i don't like jimmy butler at all, but i think he's the number three takes of the week like it doesn't get this credit all because it feels like such a stunt. It felt all fake. Like how you how rachel nichols just was just there. Yeah, but i think that makes it more of a take i think that it like isn't skips whole career, a stunt sort of see the best N.B.A. takes been rolling right now. Jimmy butler's gone from good player to great takes men in a really short period of time. What N.B.A. players have takes on beads got takes and beats got tae's. Durant has takes, they're weird takes his yacht, takes love lebron drinks with this fourteen eleven year old. What drinks wine with him really does that out there ? No, i wasn't addressing at the end. Okay, there were takes off it alright. Alright on dh. My number one takes men of the week is Peter-Gammons so that that leads us right in the Peter-Gammons. So as you have mentioned Peter-Gammons respected baseball writer, you know i haven't seen him in a decade. So he must be really old at this point because he looked old when i saw him before his career path change. He got sick. He had something going on. But then he came back and he does seem like part time stuff. Guys. So the first take of the weak from gammons that i have written down here october six Peter-Gammons if by the way, if we have somebody listened this who does a Peter-Gammons impression who could read these tweets in Peter-Gammons voice that would love to hear that in the eighth inning of what may be a do or die game with the tension of a game seven neanderthal fenway park quote, fans chanting yankee suck and he he crosses outside are eerily like those who chant lock her up at a poll rally designed to demean female assault victims. Trauma! Whoa! It was a haymaker and like in the first thing i did is i was going on through taking the year i sent this to jack and the best part, and he brought up right away is Peter-Gammons is based out of boston. He started, say, boston globe writer and he's never really hit his affection for the history. The reds like he's going after his own people. That's when you know it's a great take, all they're doing is channing yankees suck like it's. Not even that bad. He didn't have to correlate the things at all. Yeah, in fact, i don't like you, i mean designed to demean female, he says there here's, another great part of it. The fans chanting yankees sucker eerily like those who chant lock her up like everyone sort of feels like thank you. Go a certain remind you lock her up. Yeah, it does. The neanderthal is a good one that says that word will cut you. Yep, any capitalized neanderthals neanderthal something and he actually misspelled it. Hey, spell that neanderthal s o his next one gammons goes right from his locker up tweet into when the fenway security staff staff sacked the guy who ran on the field friday, he told them he was trying to save the bird that was lurking around the batting cage during and in the outfield during the game due to mlb mandating time of game restrictions or anthology ltd if he becomes a joke, sir ? Yeah, the jokes or take next ? Yep. Uh then it's very hard for indians, rockies and braves fans. But the consolation is enjoying the rest of october without seeing another peyton manning commercial. Just rose painting for no reason, just like i guess he doesn't like peyton. He rose. She was done people and he's been on commercials for ten and a half years all the time. There's the bonus. No more. Peyton manning commercial like that was in his drafts, and i didn't take Peter-Gammons as a draft to guide a draft to draft thanks-man oh, my god, like he just paid manny just shrapnel in this, just collateral damage is peyton manning, and and finally, thankfully, angel hernandez wasn't in on brown versus board of education. It would have been overturned. There's a haymaker. And zone and has had three calls overturns in a playoff game. And there's Peter-Gammons just have random thing you compared it to is, like, not even come. Not nearly as important as they gets this ridiculous. Yeah, but i mean, well, i mean, look at the sweets. All we know he was comparing minute things. Teo very serious things. Do you think maybe he had, like, a like a break, like a mental break ? Like, like some sort of psychosis ? Something happened here ? I think this is all pent up political frustration from gammons and he's using his baseball outlet to take i mean, and he had, you know, i want to talk about this actually for a second. So is his beautiful locker up tweet take got ratio it pretty hard. Three point seven thousand responses now ratio is usually the negative connotation. I know that's what i want to talk about s o so it got it got one point. One thousand likes, i would imagine easily half of those where i don't want to lose. This likes one hundred ninety one retweets and three point seven thousand replies. Now if you're listening to the r to take you know, a ratio is but people talk about the ratio when the the ratio of replies compared to ah likes and retweets is out of line and somebody came up with what that ratio is, but three point seven thousand is not the ratio you want to one point one thousand likes. Unless, of course, you're asking a question that is asking for answers. Uh, i sort of i think this is a great ratio for a take. Yeah, i think it's a positive ratio. You don't really see the positive ratio. It's usually a negative ratio. Yeah, i would. I would say that. Look, if you get forty two likes and eighteen thousand replies something's off, maybe maybe that's that but but i don't know people interacted with this content, you know, now that there were a lot of responses that were like peter, you should really cater it's time to retire the barstool guys like big cat and say, you know, trash yeah, so he ate the trash what's either trust. What is it like ? It was all peterkin thing ? Or peter have a bunch of really good tweets and then i'll do the one with the girl crying in the milwaukee restaurant write write, write when robin williams died, i don't think i know that one the girl crying in the milwaukee restaurant i don't know that he put out a tweet like i told the total waitress that robin williams died thought he'd cry and that was it. Oh, Peter-Gammons get no peer kingdom, okay ? You're okay, you're okay ? Based off of that, do you think Peter-Gammons got what he was looking for here ? What do you think the thought process was beyond that's behind this take do you think even looks at his replies, do you think he's even aware that he has almost six hundred thousand followers ? I don't think he looks and i don't think i don't think he even i really thought it was the only thought of a zit take a joke. I think he was just getting it out there. You thought it was, like, funny almost really. I thought he was studies being like oppression. But judging by the rest of his tweets which kind of sounds sort of jokey maybe he was trying to make a joke that turned into a take. Yeah, the other three. Are kind of jokey, izzy jokester now. Well, let's, let's talk for a minute about replying to takes because somebody jack just had one of his moments where he realizes what we're doing and you can't handle it. They started laughing. Ah, somebody hit us, maybe sent me a d m was it ? I think there's a d m um said that if you'll notice a lot of takes, men like Skip-Bayless do not reply to responses to the takes. They just sort of like, throw it out there and let the world burn. Well, that's, that's the joker gift from batman, right ? Yes. Do you think a true takes man replies to his takes replies, as in follows up or applies to the replies, replies to the replies, i think it's i think it's the evolution because once you do that, many followers on twitter it's like not worth it. Yeah, so then you just have to not care is howard. My father responds, like sometimes though, you gotta really bathe him like i baited him once. Really good, really ? With what ? Uh, this was back in the day. It was back when i was in college and i wasn't working here yet, and he tweeted about matt klentak and how the the tendrils trade was a good trade. And even though it's basically the same thing, i think he did, so i was like, i was like howard one is when it's klentak finally going to land the plane on dh start with and then he quote, tweeted and said, this is the right thing to do at the time. He's building the rush of the right way and then everyone's like start tweeting me like you idiot! Like you don't understand. I was like, dude, i'm just rolling. It's not that serious. Well, he jimmy kinski really got into his cross this week way were sitting there as he was tweeting back at him really ? There's something great about watching a takes hman try to respond to take yeah, yeah, and i was inspired because he he fired off the take. I told him kamsky's response and he said, no, i don't care! He didn't care at all there's something that the best takes men have where they truly don't care. Yes, they don't care about the negative responses i admire. It was a great good growing experience for my d takes menken respond. But there's a line between responding and caring, right ? Right, like howard howard does that well, doesn't care ? Will respond. Respond. Because you gotta learn, basically is what he's saying. All right, so the take a round table let's talk for a minute about last week's takes jacks take from the take a round table. This is where we each workshop a take for the week and we release it on the pod and then you vote on which the best take wass jack's take wass that stick shifts are stupid and should not exist. Um, joe's, take wass championships ruin sports there. The worst thing about sports that which is a the truth is we'll give our votes, and then my take was that nick foles is more likely to be retired next year than starting for any team. Now i got a lot of criticism for my take that it wasn't even a take. The vote had mine at fifty nine percent, yours at twenty percent, yours at twenty one percent, but easily half of those votes came out before people even got arrested because the pole went up before the podcasts went out, i think correctly, just smart, yeah, yeah. Um, i would say i think joe's take is the strongest one is the stronger it is strong, this one, it was worded differently. Like, i don't know, like you like championship. So you think that they're overrated how we evaluate sports ? Yeah, they ruin the discourse write. Yeah, but come on, i'm trying to mold it into and take that was a good thing. Yeah, wait, talk about we talk about them homes take last week. Oh, yeah. And i think well, how we approach it and how you approach it. And i i decided this week that i thought that bill simmons, i know we whatever bills, you know, polarising, but i thought his take on the holmes was the best take. Thank you. Compared the homes to the steph curry of the mba. I've take on this. Actually, i just like i like that he the way he word it made a lot of sense with how that the game was changing. It was a big arm, just like steph was three point shooter and you've run a lot of hit people, just like the nfl is changing at the right time for pat mahomes, the N.B.A. changing the right time for steph curry on both came in at the right time and kind of revolutionized the league it's a decent take, i guess my favorite did you hear it on jalen and jacoby, or did you hear it on the podcast broadcast ? My favorite part about when he talked about his podcast is he brings it up, he goes, i can't do a bill simmons impression, but follow kill a cow on twitter. You can do that, he goes. He just casually says, patent homes, the steph curry of of the nfl and cousin style sound like does not take the bait, just like keeps talking, and simmons says it again, and cousin sal ignores it again. And finally, simmons, like will not stand for it says, i went on jalen jacoby this week, i said that pat mahomes is the steph curry of the nfl and here's, why we're going to do this now ? Yeah, this is my podcast, we're going to do this so it's okay, pat mahomes, that sort of sounds like a certain thing. Pat mahomes is like the honest of the nfl in that, like, if you don't, if you only watch the highlights of johannes. You think he's really spectacular, but then when you watch the whole games, you realize he's, not quite as different as you thought. He was, like, pat mahomes is really good, but he is not changing the nfl. He's. Just the nfl is different, and he is taking advantage of that. You know, it was kind of change before he got his skill set is not steph curry. Skill set is way different than any other person. That's come before him, pat mahomes is not. Takeable takeable i've watched, i think bill's him is full of shit there take all right, who's going first, i've joel ist it first. So why are we doing multiple takes or just one cause i have two takes and i need to know about from narrowing it down on a non sports day. Yes, okay, so doing both okay and will only vote on the sports take, though, okay ? I'll start with the non sports take and then i will get the sports day. Yeah, i think we as a society oh, boy have ruined pizza pizza here's why ? And i thought about this for a long time. My wife way have no standard to pete's anymore. And you can anyone aside, space like oh, this is great it's pizza. No, it's sucks. Most pizza isn't good most pizza place don't try anymore whoa, because they know we don't care like pizza should be great and i don't like most pizza i'm handed. Wow, i think people i eat any pizza, you are the problem and the problem because i just like all pizza, right ? People ? Just like the idea of their eating pizza doesn't matter if the crust is bad. If the sauce is bad, the cheese is running like where our pizza standards. Wow. Have you been attack and alleys ? And we should all they brought it here to it to the evening show. Different tech and alleys. Okay, so there's tack in alleys in new jersey, which is the one who brought their very good packing our technologies in port richmond. You have to call ahead and reserve the amount of does you want. This is the kind of pizza place i want to be a we should taken art-of-the-take trip to tak analyses from a night when you guys are off. Maybe a monday or something. Okay, because you guys don't work mondays. We should get we said hi, workmen all right, shoot. Yeah, we'll go a different day. We'll go and we'll make it happen. Yeah, we'll make it happen. All right ? I just think it's the whole piece of their higher standard wow. Whole pizza to a higher standard is a great take. All right, here's, my sports take and it actually feeds into this what we're just doing towards the end of the show. Okay ? I think steph curry is the most underappreciated N.B.A. superstar ever and i think when he's done he's going to be the second best scarred in the history of basketball on lee behind michael jordan, i think it's a great take. I agree with the take, but i think it's a great take because it will infuriate people. Something is better than durant. Oh, he's clearly better than direct and it's around a guard. Now i'm just talking about like, if you're if you're comparing those toe like you think you think curry is gonna end up higher on the all time list, then durant, i do and i think he's the second best guard ever behind michael think he already has many points is magic magic was done in thirty one years old like i think about the other great guards. Jerry west's! Get him out, wade! I mean, who the great guards will tum oscar robertson he's gonna have thirty thousand points, kobe, kobe he's better than kobe he's more fish than kobe he's gonna have the ready has two mbps kobe one one ndp you're can we not delve too much into this ? Take us is ruining my take that. I just could we get off a coat like that curry's second best card ever bank okay, all right, my non sports take i think we'll all agree that people on bikes are annoying, but the people on bikes on the sidewalk are way more annoying than people on bikes in the street, people on the bikes, on the sidewalk or dangerous like if i'm driving a car, a biker is not hurting me. The worst thing that happens is i hit the biker, but he pretty bad because he's probably dead it's never told it's called aside walk they're called free throws. It's called free because all right, here's, my sports take what do all of these players have in common in no specific order ? Michael jordan, wilt chamberlain, bill russell, magic johnson, larry bird, lebron james, steph curry, kevin durant, akeem olajuwon, tim duncan, shaquille o'neal, kareem abdul jabbar, oscar robertson, dirk novitski, isiah thomas the pistons want jerry west, steve nash and james harden ndp awards they're all better than kobe. Kobe is the nineteenth best N.B.A. player of all time i love it, i have never bottle cause i Gritty i'm trying to think of who you didn't name now. That if we could get him out of the top twenty altogether, i coming, i tried. I think there are guys that are currently in the league like anthony davis, i think will be remembered as a better player than kobe bryant if he ends up in the right spot, but but not yet not yet, but i think all of those guys are my take. My sports take is kobe bryant is the nineteenth bess N.B.A. player of all time. All right, okay, jack so my nonsports take this might piss you off. The only reason the fu fighters are viewed as a good band is because no one else is competing with them and the people that stand for them a cz one of the great bands of all time are prepping them up in a police like my generation's music standpoint, they are the carmelo anthony of bands, a likely hall of fame or the few hits viewed as a superstar when really they aren't and they're washed and that you stopped touring. Drops the phone. I agree with your stance on the foo fighters. I think they're the most overrated band of all time. They are pretty good in concert, and i don't think they should stop torey, but i understand why that part of the take is necessary. I get it, i get it. I just think that i think they're good, but i think people overrate them because this generation of music is terrible but like rock music, there's no good career touring rock bands that compared to them, i would agree with that's like the pizza thing. There's no standards anymore. Why are we holding the foo fighters and pizza higher ? Andi guess my sport, all right ? My sports sick is that people don't actually want parody like i think parody is something that people claim that they want, but they don't actually want it. Like i enjoy seeing titans of the sport taken down more than like like a cz brewers world siri's or something like that. Can i tell you what i like about this ? Take it isn't that parody is overrated, it's that people are lying about liking parody their flat lying. No one likes it. On they prove it by not watching when those teams get to it's. Ridiculous. No one wants parody. They just say parody parody because that the good talking point also parody in itself at least ambassador is a myth. There never was parody know theirs and their camp a parody in the n b a. And i think parody makes the nfl worse. I think that the best times in the nfl was when there was a great team that people could gun for, whether it was the cowboys or the forty niners or the sealers. Yeah, i would agree that you two could take thank you, it's. Good take. I'll take on fellow takes man because i'm disappointed. And then this week, okay, isa lot like it, the whole you know, just just the mount rushmore in the whole of the good ones the elite level takes. And i'm disappointed last week because lebron comes out and says that he drinks with us. Fourteen eleven year old yeah, drinks mine with them. Yeah. And there was nothing did skip that. There was no visual reaction. There was no like people are a little afraid of attacking lebron like in a social way personal e i just think that all that's gotten desensitized like drinking, whatever but like, like we has been desensitized to wear, like when a guy gets caught with one of guys caught with weed it's like, well, it's not that big of a deal where is like, ten years ago ? I've been like that guy's a scumbag and all that stuff and like, i think, almost like lebron drinking with his kids has been desensitize the kids thing beyond the take. Is that why you don't go there and like it's ? Like we all understand ? I don't mean everything else is fair game, i think ten years ago lebron's getting crucified for this. Yeah, for saying they trained you right ten years ago, lebron got crucified for changing teams. Stupid. All right, this has been the art-of-the-take please leave us either a five star or one star rating on apple podcaster io three stars no three starts to leave your takes in the reviews should i post this tonight during the eagles game or should i ? The prime time to post podcast is usually like early in the morning or should i just let it fly ? I always like letting it fly. Okay, i'll post it. I didn't let it fly, let if that's, the way that takes monroe ll just have to take you live, fly, you can't see. Can't sima ron, take there's, no outro music, so we can have more time for takes.
