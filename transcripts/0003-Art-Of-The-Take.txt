Yeah, boy, that sounded gross. Another mike actually, hopefully, we're recording. Yes, we are. We are of the take. Welcome to the art-of-the-take podcast. Take take god is all this. Take a podcast four takes men by takes men, a podcast that honors good takes disgraces bad takes and breaks down takes and we do not have an intro we do not have intro music because we need more time for takes i am Spike-Eskin along with W.I.P. evening host Joe-Giglio choe. Hi, spike, they art-of-the-take but we have somebody takes this week. This is a special episode two yes and all N.B.A. a episode of the art-of-the-take celebrating the start of a new N.B.A. season also with us, as always W.I.P. and the gobert's podcasts and the high hopes podcast own Jack-Fritz hijack the art-of-the-take thie art-of-the-take you know someone left and we'll get to itunes reviews in a moment. We want you to leave your takes in the itunes reviews and leave either one or five stars will read the best takes on the podcast. Someone said that they could not give us five stars when twenty percent of the art-of-the-take twitter feed is just the art-of-the-take with several exclamation point that should be a five star right there that i think those my favorite tweets, we send out the art-of-the-take thie art-of-the-take all right, it is a special all N.B.A. a edition N.B.A. probably now maybe it's, just because i'm embedded in N.B.A. twitter in a way, i think the n b a is the most socially active as far a social media and social media does up the take quantity the tae kwo shen do you think the n b a is the best sport ? Four takes, i think it's undoubtedly the best sport for takes because it's so individual like it's a team game but there's all the individuals you can attack right to praise or you just have takes on me while the other sports it's harder to do that you can but there's so much more going on, right ? The thing i enjoy most about N.B.A. takes is thie slander of the old players. Like where it's like will you could've played hazel. What ? Nerlens ? No. Well, today yeah, i they bring me so much joy and then i feel like in the mba more than any other sport, you get the most. Well, actually takes men because, yeah, because the mba big lebron's a perfect example where the numbers say's clutch, but you really don't think he's that clutch right it's a lot of well, actually, i saw well, actually today there's a lot, you know, i think, you know, started a lot of the old N.B.A. slander comes because thie N.B.A. a has such a young fan base, and twitter is on there and they're so embedded in advanced statistics. I saw one today, somebody talking about aaron beans in a negative way, and it was a well, actually he's a borderline elite room protector and maimed three stats that i don't even understand and i know about advanced N.B.A. stats, but three that i don't even know how to calculate there's a ton of, well, actually going on a ton of, well actually takes man, i'll say this is well, the reason why the N.B.A. is probably the best is because because of the league pass or and there's so much on tv there's so much N.B.A. a on tv i think everybody sort of knows who everybody is and the to your point about so many individuals being in. It like in baseball, i know i'm the program director W.I.P. but i think i don't even know eighty percent of the players on the other team, so i wouldn't even know what you're talking about the thing with baseball where, as, like older generation for growing up like they idolized mantle mays, all those guys for our generation were idolizing lebron and are idolizing like, i think it just changed in that way, so we're like where's baseball players used to be the heroes, per se i feel like basketball players are now viewed as super here i am there's something to that, like, if i gave it, take about mookie betts from the red sox he's really good ? Yeah, like you don't even know, but if i give you think about russell westbrook, everyone knows russel westbrook and his highlights. I think the N.B.A. is great about putting their highlights out there on twitter, where the takes live and to that end even even think about okay, i don't know who is the same level of player in baseball that andre robertson is on the thunder, but he's like just some normal player, but everyone on N.B.A. twitter knows who he is knows what he's good at knows what he's bad at and if you throw a take out there that, like andre robertson's, actually better for your team that carmelo anthony, everyone knows what it means. There's a take that works the N.B.A. the best sport for takes right now so i was a football is the most overreaction takes like footballs very like on the day it z a trying time on twenty sundays are big like that's the day that nfl take on thursday doesn't pop now no, but sunday, like most traction, happens on something. Yeah, there's just the quantity of N.B.A. takes is because of the games and because, you know and we'll get to the national writer's later, but they're just firing off so many takes. I'm starting to get annoyed, though with the use of capitalization and takes an mba twin. Wow, we didn't even see this wasn't even on the run down. How do you mean ? Because like everything else, we capitalize now like, oh there's, jeremy lamb entering into the game and like rather than like it's, did you notice this ? I don't even know what this is, who's. Doing it, there's, a certain member of sixes twitter that uses a lot of capitalization. Hold on, let me think about this now. Now i think there's a lot of yelling isn't like modelling after skipping through corrigan thirstiest guy and sixers twitter no offense, i've heard from numerous sources i've met drew is a good guy, but everything is, you know, omg kell wet, wet, wet yes water emoji and then three second gif of marquel faults ah, following through on a jumper that maybe didn't even go in. Or is the picture of a jumper's now automatically as jumpers back ? Very true ? Very true ? Well, as requested, we're going to do a little so some guy on twitter did you guys to see this ? That guy that set up the computer algorithm to record how many times we say take in an episode of art-of-the-take i didn't realize this happen is amazing. Yes, so the first episode it was two hundred twenty two times who said they were taken the second one if you include takes hman, i think it was close to three hundred and the second is insane that's a lot of time as andrew sharp said this is the perfect podcast for people who spend too much time on the internet speak of which all right, so on the show today, we will have our itunes review takes we will have our take report card, our takes, manpower rankings, a new segment, the james seltzer thirstiest taste take of the weak, of course names after W.I.Ps james salter, who had a ridiculous, thirsty tweet about j j saying philly will always love you, you know, blah, blah, blah, please. Favorite my tweet. Yep, yeah. Thirsty has taken away the honorary james seltzer. Thirsty is taste the weak and, of course, to take a round table where we all offer a sports take a non sports take and you tell us which take you like the best before we get to the itunes reviews takes i think, you know, you could say for us and for the take community that take honor the take hunter siri's is like the godfather iss on or of the wire to N.B.A. people you know that. You know, i feel like what percentage of people who say the water was the best show ever didn't even watch the wire, billy's. Like ten percent, right ? Oh, yeah. Twenty five that's trendy thing to do. Yeah, so take connor is wonderful. So if you haven't watched it, take hunter is a sort of what's the word i'm looking for, sort of like joke merete parody of of mine hunter the show that was on netflix. Really good show done by the folks over the ringer shout out to chris ryan, teo teo, jason concepcion and who else is in that ? Mike is michael peter who's. The third guy is some ringer guys, some other ringer guy. But it's really, really, really funny. And it is about a guy who's. So mine hunter is about this. These two cops that end up interviewing serial killers to get in the minds of the serial killers in this this three part siri's that was that started maybe eight months ago. It is the guy, the murderer guy. And the guy does an excellent impression of the guy and mine hunter about as good as possible. This guy who just gives the hottest N.B.A. takes he is like the the serial killer of takes hman. And in the first episode, if you haven't seen it, he talks about he remembers they going to interview him and he's in prison. For some reason, even though it's just it takes months if they was in a crazy hospital bill, is that one of us thinks so ? So they asked him. You tell us about your first take and he starts talking about how he told his parents that the bull should play ron harper over michael jordan. And they laughed at him on dh. That was what started it. So the third and final chapter of take hunter was released on tuesday. What did everyone think ? It was definitely the conclusion of it. This seems like the end of the take hunter siri's joe, your impressions of take under three. I loved it. I thought that chris ryan kind of losing his mind and the idea that if you really think about it all takes at some point are correct. It's like it's a mind blowing experience, the watch him go through that well. And it was it was it touched on reality for me because the take that he's talking about was when the takes one murder a guy goes and this was takes me to this. Was in take one or two, he goes. The key to the sixers this year is give belinelli the keys, it's belinelli. And that hurt for you during that time that you were on this big anti belinelli thing about batty is he was my least favorite six or since of like of the process i hated belen and chris ryan is sitting there on his laptop, watching the belinelli shot that he was on the line for and here's the game three. Yeah, of the semifinals against policy. Just watching it over and over. Losing his mind. Yeah, losing his mind, laughing maniacally, going he's, right ? Every take. The reason that every take his right is because at at one moment in time, every take was right. I thought it was brilliant. I really enjoyed the third. The third installment of take honor. Jack your impressions. I gotta be honest. I expected more from take on her. I thought the first four minutes were great. I really enjoyed the chris ryan breakdown. I will say i don't like how it ended. I didn't bill was funny and i know you're a bill. You're a bill demo team i love. Bill, i thoroughly enjoyed bill's work it's just that i wanted more takes and it got too active for me. I didn't want more acting from people who aren't really actors. You wanted more silly. I wanted more text. I wantto wasn't believable. I will give you that. I wanted another nickel. Yokich is actually the fastest player in the N.B.A. and i just didn't get it. Live up to my takes hunt take under standards his the takes written in it given by this guy. How close like how close were they percentage wise ? Two actual takes that exist there takes that. I could see believe theo gets one. Yeah is obviously ridiculous, but like seventy five percent of their well. And i think i think some six, fans. May fifty five, fifty five belinelli joe ingles. He called you ingles about the best player in the league, didn't he ? There's a case to be made there. Come on, thie guise of basketball savant sixty are all go six. One point. Every take is correct. The belinelli take it for a moment for a moment when when the first take hunter came out, it opens up with chris ryan. And a couple of ringer writers. And, you know, the guy writes the peace and chris ryan goes, this piece is pretty good, but it doesn't have a take like every it's all gotta have a take. He goes, you know what ? If they start throwing, like, you know, takes out he goes, what if kyrie irving's right in the world is flat like that's ? A take ? And i texted chris as soon as it happened, and i said, you have no idea how close that meeting is to my actual life. Your joke meaning of that takes is exactly how my real life is, and it touched me, i thought, taken or touch me, i thought, i understand and, you know, as an artist, you know, a band after they make their first album, and if they change up styles as they go on their career, there was a portion of the fan base that just wants to them to keep mate remaking the first album. And while i understand the point of the artist that they want to keep pushing it, i understand the fan to they just want more of the first, you know what it was. Like, in the beginning, i understand what you're saying, but i do think that chris ryan gave a oscar worthy tour de force while performance, and i and i i i thought it was great, though i would like maybe some deleted scenes with extra takes, which there, there, you know that we just want more take. Yeah, i just i think from a takes man perspective, i was inspired for two reasons. One, we all should know that deep down every take is correct at some point, right ? Everything matter what you say. Yes, right at some point. And the other thing was, you know, you mentioned the godfather of the wire for takes man, i imagine a lot of aspiring takes men are listening. Watch this. This is like a film class watching the godfather. You need to watch it right ? Even if even if you need thio two tone yours down, seeing the extreme version of the take really paints what you're trying to dio and no fear the guy had no fear. You know, he is i think one of my favorite lines in the first one was because i think i tweeted this one that you wants ? Like, what is it ? But he is really just that he is the part of your gut that believes it. Yeah, i think that deep down he is deep down. So he's fully that ? Yes, yes, in real life. So congratulations. Everyone of the ringer on take hunter three so we'll get to the take report card a moment first r i that the takes from apple podcasts and i and itunes reviews. We want your five or one star ratings. Everyone should leave a five or one star rating. That's what a good take is. You even want to give it five or one stars ? No three stars. Please were upto ninety one total ratings. Twelve one star reviews. I think the rest five star reviews, maybe two. Three star reviews. So this one comes from liberal ballers. His subject. He gives us one star. The subject line is with three separate pods. Spike must really think highly of what he has to say. I love his non sports. Take any movie with a horse in it is boring. Three straight to the point yet is boring. I like seabiscuit. I've never saw seabiscuit. I do like the one with bobcat goldthwait where the horse can talk now he's a gambler i've seen this as you have takes the horse has taken on, then let it ride has horses in it, but the horses in a start with richard dreyfuss, so but i do like it and it's just so out there, like who who gets up on a day saying, you know, every movie of horses in it, it's boring as a general rule, i think horses are overrated, so i like this take yet so i think this is if i were what we'll get to greet the taking to say, and his sports take donovan mitchell regresses and the jazz will miss the playoffs. I don't even i would love to hear the reasoning behind that take, but it is always a good take. Next one comes from will ask to six, eight two ah dwayne wade proved one thing during this career that he could only win titles when a first ballot hall of famer was on the roster with them. Shack lebron ray allen the consummate robin to someone else's batman this is a great take, it's a tremendous sake! My favorite part is easily just slight, and ray allen in there ? Yes, andrea was great player, but sliding him in there. That's, a really dig that way, because ray allen, it was like the end of his career, right ? Yeah, because he think that ray allen is better than dwyane wade with the well, i don't know. I don't know. Ray allen with the heat rail with the heat ray allen's best round with the heat and the consummate robin to someone else's, batman and here's. Why it's good is like one responses like give it. No one's ever won a title without another first ballot hall of famer on that like no one in history. But he's, right, he's. Right. That's the thing it's a it's. A correct it's a grade. If i regretting this or so, it would be in a take. And then i love this one. This one is Philadelphia based stevie d one two three his he gives us five stars. The subject line is teo is the worst player in eagle's history. He came into a team that had won eleven, eleven, twelve and twelve games. The four years prior he played in fourteen. Regular season games went oh, and one in the playoffs. Then he managed to sabotage the team from within. Completely ruin the next five years of potential dynasty. And i felt twitter's love for this man cracks me up he's, not a winner. He always made his team worse and he should have never been a hall of famer in fifteen years. Oh, bjs hall of fame case will be similar i'm sure nfl twitter will shame anyone who doesn't vote for that team. Ruin her as well. It's an outstanding this's a friggin fire! Take it is well, actually it is that's the that's the i believe that's a category it's. And it is well backed up. It is i mean it's friggin tremendous. Take a shot at o b j hey, pass president. Future takes all wrapped in together, he's predicting the future and he's totally spot on that's. Exactly what's gonna happen ? Yeah. And okay to say descended the receiver the second most yards in nfl history. It is not a hall of famer, not a hall of famer and the worst player in eagle's history. And if you read this, you know, sometimes the best takes, you know, because they touched that thing inside of you. Even if you disagree that you sort of agree. This is a good argument. Forget about, like, as a take. This is a pretty solid argument i like takes that will bend the truth to fit the narrative you want and he's got this splitting here played in fourteen regular season games that he leaves out. They were what thirteen and one of those games where the record was outstanding on went on one of the playoffs came back to play in the super bowl against the patriots. Yeah, yeah, he played great and they lost. But that's the truth. He played in fourteen games on one of the players. Come on, then. That's a fricking amazing great. Alright time for the take report card in the tape report card let's do a little more breaking down. I think you know, somebody commented that last week a couple of things that we had him there. We're not actually takes and we didn't even grade them. We just ella welded them now we did get some itunes comments. The he's a loser moment got us some itunes itunes reviews with he's a loser in it. It was amazing. Amazing moment. So the first one, the first one comes from one of our biggest fans. Hey, is just sort of like art-of-the-take fanboy. It really does. Yet they are andrew sharp of sports illustrated in the open floor podcast. So this week on open floor podcast, which is actually the on ly N.B.A. plowed cast that i listen to consistently, i'll be honest here they did a question for each N.B.A. team as a season preview, and toward the end of this, three hours of podcasting, they finally get to the toronto wrappers and sharp rat raptor and sharp, just exasperated lets out this this beauty. I just want to be very clear. The reasons to doubt the raptors are that every single player on their team is like ten to fifteen percent overrated. Kyle lowry is not as good as the collective basketball community says he is kawai leonard is not on kevin durant's level, and yet there are a lot of people who are kawai believers who will tell you that he is and we'll go back and say, you know, cause i was guarding katie and he was really good and like i was a draw like fuck out of here no preach, preach, preach you go, preach, preach seaq um and o g like seaq, um, is not ever gonna be anything close to what draymond green was oci is never gonna be kawai norman powell is like, shouldn't get more. Than fifteen minutes a game. Fred vanvleet is the only player on their team that is actually good and he's someone who i actually love. Whoa, fred vanvleet is the on ly good rapture on a team with kyle lowry and and ah, while in kwai liner haymaker at the end, yes, i mean, he laid into the whole friggin team, and i think we can say he put the entire N.B.A. twitter in his crosshairs on that because he was basically mowing down everyone who isn't good, but everyone says it's good. You know, i think there's, you know, we thought by takes that have the truth behind them, that one does, and i feel like that's always kind of been the raptor. They always have players that everyone thinks they're great, but they're not as great as you think they are. Yeah, everyone in toronto is probably really upset with that. Oh, i'm shandra sharpe is enemy number one in toronto can't go to canada anymore. Yeah, and i sort of agree of all the raptor. I don't know if fred vanvleet is the only good one, but that's what makes it a good take that he pushes ? It a little too far. He's the only wrapped er that i would want to watch that i'm that i care about, i guess. But he's definitely not the only good rapture, but that is not seen with cocoa island. But, i mean, you know, he is right that everyone overrated coop quiet was very good. But i think everyone, rightly so, even though they want don't want to admit it out loud has their doubts about him. Not on the spurs. Like not within that infrastructure just is like a bucket. Get her guy he's. Not on kevin durant's level he's. Not i think. There's something about marrying those two two because he did guard him well so like so he could play with them and sharps like, no, not even close. Yeah, that is a lie. I need to see it craps on all the young players and then never meet your i'm hungry like no shot. Is there anything you would change about the tape ? Is there anything, any, any weakness in it ? Do you think i like the haymaker at the end ? I think it would have been fun if you just came out and started. With fan fleets, the on ly good player on the team and then went on the rant after that. Yeah, i mean that's, sort of the way that i'd say the structure takes around here tell him to take backup to take tell him to take again also, he could've worked in like toronto is a perpetual loser and, like they're regular season team only. And even though lebron's out of the, they still have no chance to win the cv. Yes, that has went back to the past like vince carter was always over it like just really get on toronto. Toronto has always been over drake. I work in a drink reference. Yes, the outbreak also over. Well, i don't think he was planning it. That's the best part of that's. What ? What good is what takes really down there in the gut ? Yep. Um, the next one comes from david young one hundred state like his last name. Like laid low jerry lately, gary so legs is a well known guy of sixers. Twitter was my co owner of my fantasy basketball team that we won the league with last year now tank because he took faults. Oh, he did he's tanking now in a league with john gonzalez in a league with mike. Eleven. We won and i walked away. So and legs is the guy that really uncovered a good portion of the barbara bettini being responsible for the bryan colangelo twitter thank like the big sixers guy after the sixers came let's out. Just a flamethrower of a take joe folse and simmons played well. Cover played well on defense and hit a couple of threes. J j mr ton of open looks dorio never settled in. Jo jo was too frantic and struggled. Tj needs to play a ton versus celtics sham. It was used as a j j clone team needs a year. Chandler, you skala there's. A lot of takes in there. It's minutes like seven or eight takes none. One take. It starts off with the real haymaker in there, but i feel like he comes back to it. Which is why i like it. He starts off with false and simmons played well. Now simmons was obviously the best guy on the court for the sixers and fault teo. Any casual observers ? I it was the worst player on the team it's been non stop talk in the city of philadelphia for a day and a half. But how bad marquel faults was ? He leads what faults was good. Yes, he was unfolds and simmons were good. It is putting in the same category, right ? But he was clearly not good. And then he just he brings it up in the back where he brings up the best player on the team. And bead folks was good. Been a bead was frantic. Like right, like, false was good, but bead was not good. I don't know if this was meant, but as it takes. But i'm gonna assume he meant this because there's no award it takes men use it's not deliberate. He put two frantic as if he always expects frantic plate of m b. But in this one, a little too frail, too much. And then you know what ? The team needs to be the selfish this was another one. And this is i believe in nut. A nudge in the rib cage of the celtics team needs iter smith ah player who has never played a moment than N.B.A. game was drafted, everyone saying that he's. Two or three years away, if the team just had your smith, they would've beating this team that they lost by eighteen points. Sire smith and michael scala and mike mascot, right. No one really knew until three days ago for the wrong reasons, who played fifteen minutes a game on the worst team in the league last year. Yeah, so now he was the real question i have. We're going to get to our thirstiest take of the of the week award. A little bit later, they listen to the podcast who likes know the thirstiest take thursdays takes award, but i don't think he does know i'm here. If he was going to there's. No way he doesn't know, yeah, yeah, yeah, and then we'll get back to him. I'm sure, but i think we can all agree that thirsty take is not actually a good take. His legs is take accident only good, or is it actually good like, does he believe you ? Does he actually believe that false was good like, was he go ahead ? I think what he was trying to do was tryingto i think he's trying to still talk about faults with the gloves off, and he wasn't expecting the visceral reaction to meet with the yes with the gloves on, right ? Right, right. And like he was a gay played good. So so like, which is what everyone in six years, twitter has border before game one more game, correct. And then after game one, everyone's, like we talked about that you played terrible thank you. He preemptively put it out while thinking the kid gloves are still on with marco. Have we stumbled upon a new kind of take here one where you throw it out there and you don't realize, really what you're fishing for ? He go fishing, you think you're going out there for blue fish ? All of a sudden you're reeling in a shark is i think he reeled in a shark here. He didn't expect the internet to be so mad. Yeah, i don't think he expect into this take thinking it was going to be a scorcher. The accidental take man the accidental take min is what he was there. You know, we're going to skip the case if anyone because this is N.B.A. only actually, you know what, replace because we'll skip the shermer one as well. We'll replace it with the take about national N.B.A. guys. But before that, you want to do angelos, toso, angelo and the totality of ninety four W.I.P. just comes out day one for the sixth season, even starts and just stomps on it. He says the sixers will win forty seven games this season, five less than last season. They're no better than last year and it will be slightly improved henceforth zone wins. Sorry, truth hurts it's a it's a perfect angelo choice. The truth hurts of the end like on the one who knows this. I don't understand how no one else knows this and here where that got me was sorry, sha're like, listen, i don't want to have to do this, but this is my job around here to do this. Sorry, and that is really the this was on twitter and but angela would never tweet don't at me but that's really what that end ? Wass sorry the truth hurts is don't at me, don't add me. Ah, wonderful, take everyone the over under is fifty four games, seven games under the over under a really solid take and wait, did he win ? Yeah, seven under the over under they want fifty two last year to go backto all takes are at some point, correct. There was some feeling of this when you watch the first game of the season like they're not better a worse yes, sorry, the truth hurts like i saw angelo's tweet as i watched him loosen the celtics. Yeah, he was he was at least remember every take is right, at least for a moment, and we'll wind it up with kill a cow. You might know him is at k i l l kow he's, the guy on twitter who really loves lubanga's, mambo number five and celebrated when when mlle obama took number five with the orlando magic national N.B.A. writers who troll fan bases without revealing or having a team of their own are cowards and use their general ism to hide behind the fact that they don't know anything. I mean, that is to take that to take alright so to me this is a take directly at guys like that more zach harper, who cover all the teams somehow are always on twitter and are always firing takes at N.B.A. fan bases and sort of acting like they're not firing takes, but they are firing takes and they really are just to rile up the fan bases and here's. The other thing i've learned from you know, we had i remember had kate fagan on the ricky once, and this was after she was done coming the sixers now she's on espn and text her it was like, hey, will you come on she's like, yeah, it's, like, i got to warn you like, i only know surface level stuff about the sixers now, and when we had her on, she was, like, it's, impossible to follow all of the teams like you guys follow the teams, so when you think about it, like, i know they're making pretend that they're on, like, leak pass all night, they're tweeting about each game so you can see that you're there tweeting about each game. But these guys really can't know that much about all these teams. It's impossible, right time wise, like, how do you do it ? We'll have takes on everyone but you can't like there's something there's substance behind the take, probably not there well, and they're very condescending about like that they actually do know, like about everything about all of these guys. Yeah, and like, listen to bill simmons over under podcast, and he talked for the sixers in such a naive, clearly not paying attention away, but, like i wanted the other fan bases feel that about their team and like, it just invalidates his whole N.B.A. opinion in general, like when i think about him breaking out of six years like, well, that doesn't make any sense. Then i assume he's not making any sense for the other teams that he's also talking about fan bases, you know, i'm saying, how does national people rise ? The point where their opinions respected because they have takes because it takes right ? So what he's a killer cows actually saying, and i love the thing about them being cowards, which is think is your favorite word for it to work into a thing ? What did you see the way i'm wearing ? I am wearing it the benson and shoot a three coward t shirt that i am wearing to the sixers home opener tonight, and he wants you to three. Well, here's here's, one of the things i feel like we need to do a sixers fans, we need to own this. This needs to become ours and not the sixers fans think we're the ones that say, shoot a three coward, not you guys and it disarms the celtics fans. Yes, i'm saying shoot a three coward. All right, so there is great the take way. Have next on the rundown. James seltzer. Thirstiest, please, like might sweet takeable taking the week. All right, so this named after, of course. James seltzer on twitter, host of the show live james seltzer named after you had the james sounds a moment memorial. Yeah, they're still with us. Yeah, wait. We talked about his thirsty take last week. This is a take that has meant on ly to get, like, cheap likes and retweets. This one comes from former W.I.P. host this. We're using brian's, right ? Thiss comes from brian start, ari, what don't think listens to the but it was probably that, but jack who's giving this one i got you got it. Okay. Uh marchal faults didn't ask me. Drafted number one full student trade away a lottery pick and pass on jason tatum. Folse is twenty years old. He's played less than three hundred minutes in the mba. Give the kid a frickin chance before blaming him for everything. He's symptom not the cause. Now, please. Like my tweet, i gotta say, though, it does have some truth in it in that marco fault actually did ask to go number one, i think by entering the draft. But being the symptom and not the cause is there is a little truth in that. But bye. This is thirsty because there is such an enormous group of sympathetic sixers fans that refused to blame marquel faults for anything or admit that he's not good. This caters right to those people that reminds you how hard he worked all summer to visit one hundred fifty thousand dumpers. Yeah. So how many likes did he get ? Has he gotten two hundred nine ? As of this morning, i'm that's a pretty healthy number for bryant. Please. Like yeah, prickly and start ari who's. Not even a six or skies that the Flyers guy and from what i have garnered over the years. He's not really a twitter takes man, not just throw out a random thing here and there, but, like, usually it's more general observations like bruce springsteen. But this is yes, it is like most sportswriters in phillip that was a thirsty take it very, very i think you listened and wanted to be like seltzer. Really ? You think people how you think people want to be like seltzer ? I think there are people. I mean there. Are you saying that not a lot of people out there ? Yeah, that they want to know what i would want to be like. Seltzer not only have we thirst, he takes me to a new level of take ary but do you think that there will be a group that actually becomes like the thirsty takers ? Like who know what they're doing and decide to go that that's the path there's offshoots of everything i'm afraid to thursday take i let out a first you take the other day that i'm glad no one brought up. Which one was it ? I said, i'd get to it. This is a this is a take space you were thanks-man lesson i woke up on the first game day and i said this feels like when you're in high school, your friends in the hallway for the first time. Oh, i think that it was thirsty, but i felt it. I got a lot of favorites on that university thinks it was thirsty. You're begging for them. I was begging for him. That's what ? The nfl is back tweet that's what that is, but it was more than that. It was like you're imagining walking down the hallway senior boys for the first time since summer, but they were in school over six thirty's share don't don't back it don't don't defend it it was awful when your boy in the fullest jersey trips and falls. Yeah, awful so congratulations, brian. Start our e r a winner of the james seltzer memorial. Thirstiest. Alright, pigeons take of the weak now onto the takes. Manpower rankings are weekly ranking of the takes men that had the best week. Joe, would you like to start off with your power and your top-three-takesmen of yes, and specifically, i just want to talk about number three because he's a new addition to the top. Three boy Peter-Gammons and Skip-Bayless hold spots. I can not knocked them out so well. So they're number one into number one into Peter-Gammons number one, skip two eyes that take a lot to knock. Skip-Bayless gammons is just having a month. I mean, this is when he goes in there takes my hall of fame. I wonder if our number three's air going to be the same. Go ahead. Well, my number three is a guy that i never thought would become a takes hman has become a legitimate takes mond. Ok, no. See where this is going and i have to put him in the power rankings. Afternoon show producer ben livingston he's, my number three two well, look, fire. Look. Got everything. Look, i don't know if you want to know about the eggs because he was firing off, but yeah, that's. What i wanted to talk about until right before we started to record. Ben retweeted himself from last year. I haven't been this scorcher. Yeah. It's the great pumpkin, charlie brown. And it is an overrated piece of crap on is no place in the american holiday tradition. I saw this. I saw the data. And i said ben should be hosting this podcast. Yes, he should have come up with this a year ago. He's always been it takes men. Look, he still hears. And i agree with you on that because he's, my number three as well, and i'll just go into my list after that. But he because you've given your top-three-takesmen yeah. So i agree with you in in that he starts firing off. All these food takes this week and one of them is runny eggs. That runny eggs are gross and no one should like them. And you should, on ly get hard, boil their scrambled eggs, like saying that an obvious preference thing is a they're gross and nobody should have them is and i love over easy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's the only exit so he's just he's coming right at you and i'm like i said stop trying to get on art-of-the-take band, which is what i thought he was doing. But with all this fire but then you go and you look at that great pumpkin take always been firing these these takes off. Ben does not care. He's gotten no memory. You could punch. Him in the stomach one hundred times and he would still spit this fire. They're crazy. I don't agree with most of them, but but he's got takes. Ben living certain number three takes man he's, one of the most opinionated people at W.I.P.. Yes, he's got an opinion on friggin everything and it drives you mad in regular conversation. But as faras takes going before you guys go on, i want to tell you everyone how he retweeted. He didn't just hit the retweet button. He no. He quoted himself and said, i would like to reintroduce this like, i think this movie is crap. I told you a year ago, here it is again and and this movie isn't at the like a an all time. Like a new move. Loved ? Yeah, i think it's on tonight, i think that they then wanted to be topical with topical congratulations, ben. That is as our number three takes minutes. So my number two takes one of the week is Peter-Gammons moves down one spot. My number one takes men of the week is actually me for so that the celtics won sixty eight games and that they will win. The N.B.A. championship on a sixers podcast. Congratulations to the number one takes one of the week on my list. Me ? Wow. Yep. I've been wanting one yet. That's incredible. Jack, what is your top three ? I got francesa still on there because he's now using fixed that's the back of his opinion. Yes. Oh, so call it called in and said, hey, she's not aaron rodgers and air line aaron rodgers and mike said and roger is he had a good season. He has eight touchdowns and seven interceptions. The real Numbers are 10 touchdown! So why interception ? Wow. So he just uses fake stats ? Yes, to back up his opinion. How do we feel about that ? That's not even selective use of stats. It's just lying. You were just lying. Well, in the the list of one point his career, he probably had a touchdown seven years up. Probably there's a great quote. I've always like that's, not a lie if you believe it. And that's what that sounds like because you listen to him. Say it complete conviction if you drive around the car and you're a casual fan like, oh, god! He's right ? Mike said that like it's it's, right ? He says it with conviction number three mike francis. I'm gonna put gammons tio okay, didn't he had one take this week ? There was just like everyone's talking about. Well, congratulations to deadspin to catching upto us and noticing that Peter-Gammons spits fire now it would be nice if they credited the podcast obviously debt's been listens to the art-of-the-take i have no doubt that's been listens. They argue just credit us say the name next time and my number one take some of the week is angelo cataldi. I know we broke down his his take earlier. That was good. But when the manny machado story came out about him not hustling her, i knew angelo's take in my head and i wanted to hear him come out and say, not in my city. Yeah, and angelo backed it up this week by saying, i don't want manny machado here doesn't hustle. Yeah, which when i when i'm thinking about another man's take you are in my top three. Well, that's and that's sort of like the that is why angelo is so great it's why skip is great because when lebron does something good your first thought is i wonder what skips goingto say about this scene with tebow scene with anything like that. So yet that's what makes him that's ? What makes him so great is that you want to hear his opinion on the underrated part of it, even though he was anti machado and i you know what i saw when i heard his take and knew what his take was coming. I saw the shack, the kobe to shack alley oop in nineteen ninety nine. Machado played it up for me like it was the alley oop to and slow to slam. He actually said in his quote, this is for you, angela anybody's. Well, there's like a lob city for takes don't want Philadelphia it was it was it was good all right, time now for the take a round table last week, state that this is all when we give a sports taken on sports take we put it up on twitter for you to vote which one is the best take joe's take last week was that when all is said and done, steph curry will be remembered as the second best guard of all time behind. Michael jordan jacks take was that parity is a fraud. Nobody actually likes parody and and it's like worse in real life than people will admit. And my take was that kobe bryant is the nineteenth best N.B.A. player of all time the one take back to your take that was old two thousand ten take yeah, no, my there were far fewer votes this time mine wins with forty seven percent of the vote. I do think it is a little unfairly skewed as many of the twitter followers came from my begging so it sounds like these people are sucking up to you. They are a little bit so i win again. What order do we want to go ? I forget where we went last last week. I think joe in first you want to go first ? Sure. Nonsports think. Okay, bumper stickers are really two signs of one's insecurity about themselves. Explain this off become this all comes from i saw a guy with the trump bumper sticker and i'm just thinking to myself, this guy is he loves to say i don't care what anyone thinks, but in reality he cares what it cares what ? Everyone thinks. And then it got me thinking about how, like you're my son's, an honor student, that's, a sign that i'm a good parent, or trying to show people that i'm a good parent, right ? My son's, a cup boy scout, like eagle scout or whatever, or even like the ones with three letters about where you go on vacation planning it's, twenty six, point to like, oh, you completed a marathon. Great, yeah, right, it's all about once in security about himself, i like it, what's your sports, take ah, well, how's, the N.B.A. record for going N.B.A. you're on via N.B.A.. Take watching magic johnson. I see nothing more than a six. Nine michael carter williams. That is scorcher and has no left and go! Whoa, you don't think of the right! I don't want to comment on it cause i don't rescue the voters. That is an impressive take that's good. Um, you go second, i'll go ok ? All right, my non sports take is that all sales ? Our bullshit ? They're not riel retail price is just an idea in our head they tell us it's on sale it's not really on sale. They're making it up there. There's no such thing as sales, they don't exist. Well being stand i trump dick, i know that we have people vote on the sports takes but that is going to be the best take that anybody gives. Quick put both pulls up for the non sports take in the sports for sure yeah, my sports take the utah jazz are the boston celtics of the western conference. They will be the biggest contenders the warriors this year and they will make the finals before the next western conference. He makes the finals after the warriors air done. Wow! I don't believe that at all. But that's ah that's! A take. I took their over a fifty. Winslow you're right, that's a definite take. So i'm going to give my non sports take my my sport steak and then my backup sports take because that's going to lead to another take that is a, well, it's a sizzler that jack and i wanted to address on this podcast, but we didn't want to address until the very end. Okay, so my non sports take is i do not like game of thrones, lord of the rings or harry potter because all the same wizard stuff and i don't like stupid wizard stuff again, they're not wizards. Yeah, yes, they are. Everything is the same, isn't there ? They're stragglers and magic and all of that stuff. Harry potter's a wizard, isn't it ? Yes. And it's all the wizard stuff i don't like with your stuff. I don't. I won't watch any of it. What ? All right my sports take is and that's actually an honest take. I believe it. One hundred percent, my lord of the rings. You don't even give it a chance. No, i don't like my heard. You say this before in a non take way. Believe this. Yes, i believe one hundred percent just like i won't watch team america world police because i don't watch cartoon movies. I'm not five years old, all right ? Here's, my sports take allen iverson is the fourth best player in the nineteen ninety six draft, and the minute the sixers took him, they assured themselves they were not going to win an N.B.A. championship ray, ray allen, kobe bryant, steve nash all better than allen iverson and allen iverson is just like what ? Russell westbrook and jimmy butler players that are good because they have the ball all the time, but bye bye them having the ball all the time, it assures that their team cannot be good enough to win. So allen iverson was actually the wrong pick for the six years that one there we go. All right, correct! Like now, is it too close to rio money to take ? If you think it's not even hot enough, so here's the other ? Take anyone on N.B.A. twitter who says that they enjoy watching marc gasol for al horford is just lying to make you think that they like basketball more than you do. That is bullshit! They're not fun to watch. I know what it's fun to watch on basketball is dunking and shooting and cool dribbling like zach levine. I would rather watch zach levine than al horford or mark castle any day of the week. Is this happening to do with your anti doughy guy ? Think is both those guys or do a fat ? Yes, i also don't like fact. Well, i also don't think you like when all of N.B.A. N.B.A. or sports twitter thinks like like this is how this is what means to be a smart fan. Yes, it is like it is the N.B.A. woke, whoa, calmness of the n ba is that they understand it better than you do because their understanding something that isn't even true, like it's fun to watch al horford or mark castle and then to factor they overrate both of those players and then there is another aspect, and this is a very dangerous thing to touch on. Jackie prepared for this ? Yes, a lot of N.B.A. twitter this year especially came out and was like, whoa, watching the N.B.A. wn ba is actually awesome come on like i wanted to succeed very much, but washington they didn't all watch the wn ba they didn't all just decide that the w N.B.A. was awesome and i've gotta be honest with you. I like i've tried and a really don't enjoy watching the wn ba it felt like there was a N.B.A. twitter battle to see who could be the most i love the wn ba yes, and it was between matt moore, zach harper and shay serrano. Yeah, and it was embarrassing and it was it was annoying to follow. No one cares about the wn ba you could not tell me anyone cares about the mba there's a reason why no one goes to games. It is like the fact that you're trying to tell me that the wn ba is fucking interesting. Usually it is of the lie it is a list is a lie and stop over on the timeline with N.B.A. takes that no one cares about it felt like a memo went out that that we all miss like everyone we're all watching w N.B.A. and pretend we like it. It's bad it's it's the worst sports product in america it is that bad i always i never understand why it's been propped up for so long it's you can't watch a full game and say, this is this is fine, and the other thing is that last year that commercial came out thie N.B.A. players saying yes, i watch this all the time i learned moves. No, you don't no, you don't you don't maybe it watch it, but you definitely aren't learning anybody like i hope it's a disease, but like it's, no it's, not great! I don't really hope it succeeds. I don't hope it fails. There's no part of that sits here right now is that i hope that W.I.P. succeeds. Why ? Well, if what am i getting out of it ? I don't know anyone that watches i actually feel this way about many different sports. I think college basketball was horrible and anyone who says they like watching college basketball is also lying. If they say they like it more than the mba there, get out! They haven't watched the N.B.A. i wantto watch worst basketball players by basketball ? Yeah, let me watch worst basketball players, you know, here's another take the people that say they like college basketball. What they say they don't like about the n b a is actually what ? College basketball is isolation ball. Yeah, they also just one guy doing everything in the blah, blah, blah. But that's what ? All college basketball is the one guy. You remember the kemba walker year. Like for you ? Connell when it was shipped as after that ? Yeah, jim it jimmer fredette, like took every shot on the team. Horrible product. I was the love college basketball. I wanted to write about college basketball. And i was like, wow, this is terrible, like the N.B.A. more now look, he's going in order to take podcasts are we leaving the wn ba taken here ? It brought out the most honest reactions from everyone. All right, it's an awful product. I don't like the wn ba and i think i think wants me to like you. And i think a lot of the people saying they like it, you know, he's, your something that happened, we were doing the right syracuse sanchez at the end we had so to me and mike and andrew under berger comes on at the end. God bless andrew under burger and he goes, hey, i just have, like, one other thing i want to say today, and we're like, ok. And he goes, the wn ba is actually like a great product, and everyone should watch it. Maura and and he went on this whole thing about the wn ba and i just, like, sat there and and mike was like, yeah, you're actually right ? And i texted under burger afterwards, and i was like, are you fucking with me and he's like, what do you mean that i was like, do you know that i actually i think that's horseshit at all, and he had no idea, i gotta be honest. I turned off the podcast. Really ? You left it in. I thought you delete that off the punk ass. What ? W N.B.A. no, i left it on that that's. What ? That's, what you gotta do when you're broke. That's what ? This ? Yeah, you gotta like the wnba. Wow. Well, there you go. So this has been the art-of-the-take podcast is probably the last episode of the art-of-the-take podcast. Leave, please.
