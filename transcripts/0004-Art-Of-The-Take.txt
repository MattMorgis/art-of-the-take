Jeez, louise area, welcome to the art-of-the-take the art of thie art-of-the-take the art of the tape. I am playing point guard this week Jack-Fritz evening show producer of slash future W.I.P. host along with Joe-Giglio my co host now or boss, you're my boss. What we're gonna do here guest booker wow, whatever you want to be called. Yeah, whatever it takes. Whatever. Sounds good Spike-Eskin some say, the boss of us all. Yes. Some say that makes the most sense of all these takes before. Yeah. All right. So we have a loaded show today. Oh, they art-of-the-take itt's going to be an all nfl edition of the art-of-the-take the nfl's obviously the most popular sport in america. Everyone loves the nfl. Yeah, some would say yeah, we'll get into that with some of our takes later. But we also discuss some other important things we have ah ah, beer. Take that. We all have to get out there. We would establish yourself as a certain kind of beer podcast. We also have we have to go back to the mba edition real quick because it was a just an all time week for takes. When it comes. To the mba and i haven't take about this podcast. This is the worst all nfl podcast ever write that the two things jack just teased were lebron and beer. We have a weapon to the all nfl art-of-the-take we promised this week all nfl stuff besides all this other stuff, we're going teo all nfl takes besides, nfl takes right, so we're going to the nfl stuff. Weaver itunes review we have our tape report card with giulio just almost melting down all of Philadelphia this week it was a good job by you. We have thirsty has taken the week. We have a couple of thirsty stakes the week which is very exciting, our take review and our sports and non sports take round table let's start what ? Talking about the mba and lebron because lebron against the spurs earlier this week. He's the the great thing about what happened that game as a lebron who the three pointer to sent over time that all of us pro lebron people like he's clutch c you guys were wrong. And then in classic lebron fashion, he comes back in overtime and this is two free throws and skip i imagine watching that was foaming at the mouth. Yeah, well, because we all know, especially skip skip, that lebron is not actually clutch, and we all know lebron isn't actually clutch, but he's very good and we sort of feel bad that he's not clutch. So i i think i think the reason that skips that this isthe skips best bit we say skips, skips bits, his his alzheimer's or lebron tebow cowboys anything cowboys, anything cowboys, but i think this is the best one because it is the truest one, even if he goes obviously over the top. I think lebron season is truly skips seasoned tebow had a moment, but tebow is not actually good that the cowboy stuff is basically just a troll, but the lebron thing, i believe, is his signature move, and lebron provides the content all the time, like that game was made for skip the point now where i watched lebron play and i'm thinking about skips reactions to lebron plane like he makes this shot him like, how Skip-Bayless spin this ? And then, of course, ten minutes later, the missed free throws my wallet there it is. That's! What an all timer! Does that's what that's, why he is consistently in our takes men of the week ? Because every week he's consistently outperformers projections, yet he he is the i think the one piece of feedback i've heard the most about the art-of-the-take aside from you guys say, take a lot and boys, that podcast ridiculous is you've given me an appreciation or an understanding about Skip-Bayless that i never thought i would have, and that is that is what the art-of-the-take has set out to do is set out to make people understand that understand that Skip-Bayless is a genius and all time genius and deserves his spot where we put i neverthought we we looked at his educators about takes, yep, and here we're trying to kind of tell people what's going on with takes and skip is leased the master ? Yeah, it was it was a great every time lebron does something like this. So when i used to be a lebron fan that i am not anymore, i am a sort of ambivalent about ambivalent, and i think you're kind of anti lebron at this point. Well, and now we have talked about i completely forgot about when. I was planning this fine program. Was your lebron article doubling down on the sister should not have gotten them ? Yeah, my sixes dodged a bullet by not getting lebron, which is after i wrote the article, i was like, i don't know about this one. I mean, i believe it, but i could just see deadspin or something like tearing it apart, but it was just like the six or struggled yes, absolutely, but so it used to be when i was a lebron fan and i was one of the biggest ones my father could tell you we would fight about it all the time that a week like this, i would fear, like if he missed free throws to win a game, i just i didn't want to go on the internet. I didn't want to hear it from anybody now it's, amazing! Like now, it just creates the fuel that it creates. Is lebron in history in sports history, the like the best fuel for takes ever ? There's no question, i think, because of the time he's played he's playing the entire social media era where every game is on television. He's he's the guy that spawns all the takes and he's right after michael jordan, and he was he was pronounced to be better than michael jordan. And of course, all the jordan people are like, well, that's not true, and then you have the kobe people who try to make this thing a cute little argument what i mean, i mean, look, look, if you were to play one game and how to win one game, anyone who picks lebron is lying to themselves or didn't see jordan that that is my my take on that, and i believe that to be true, but five would five lebron's beat five jordan's ? No, how no biggie was michael jordan. Never quick, he never quit in a fucking finals. Lebron quitting the fucking finals, he quit, he quit in the middle of the siri's he quit and all nfl addition of the art of the take. We're only talking about the nfl. Kikwit look, lebron would've been a good tight end their nfl way. Lebron had been one of the best sight involved and they would be the best time of all time. We're talking about the nfl just say that about N.B.A. players because they're tall enough. Yeah, but even soccer. But it's hard to be an nfl player. He doesn't. I know what he probably doesn't. Everybody, thirty could be earth's. Maybe he could be earth she's six eight to sixteen runs best should be better than nerds. And i love her. Whatever. Who who's booted in that that better tight on earth's. More lebron. Well, aged eight ? Yeah. Alright. Okay. Is that all the lebron stuff we have ? I mean, yeah, well, i didn't think you'd turn into a little abroad first, michael debate. But here we are. This is what the art-of-the-take is, but you never quit. Michael jordan never quit, so he literally did that. Why quit when he retired ? But then he came back and won three more championship, then quit again. Yeah, and then he quit again. And then he came back again. Ok, ok, now the other thing we have to discuss is there's been a growing sentiment amongst twitter that the fine beverage, the indian pale ale is actually a bad beer and it is ruined beer for a lot of people and as a pasta thing. Yes, i've gotten three tweets from three different people saying the epa has ruined beer. Why ? I have no idea. How are they ? Like beer truthers like wine. People like people that take it all too seriously. I didn't know. I don't know why i was drinkable. Because it's disgusting and should never be considered. Why this discussed it is delicious. No one actually let's wind ? No. You're lying to yourself like one. No, white is very good. While the pink cold wine is good but that's just because it tastes like tea, just use it's. Not even real. Well, juice tastes good. Just what is wine ? Juice is overrated. You know what ? I realized ? I was truly an epa guy. I start drinking. I pahs on vacation in june and i didn't know what they were. I just i just i had heard of pa's, but i thought it meant, like a real beery beer. Whatever. So i never drank it. And then i realized that a lot of vips sort of tastes like fruit or whatever. Oh, that's. Awesome. So start drinking them and i realized they got me drunk way faster away, heavier. I only need to drink two of them. And then i was like, wow! Look at all the cool cans and i tweeted the other night before i was recording a podcast i was like, should i drink this epa before i record the podcast was weeknight, everybody guess and i was like, i just picked out this based on the cool label and everybody was like, what ? Beer was a it was it's on my twitter somewhere, i don't know it has a skeleton and he's laying up against a tree and i don't know whatever is good enough reason to drink a beer and everybody was like that's how everybody picks i possess and i was like, ah, that's, why it's fun ? This is amazing. Yeah, i thought i paid people were like wine people who like swirly it around. And so when i was in it like a bunch of assholes, but they just they pick. They picked the beer based of the cans, which is awesome. Correct ? I didn't know people may i could understand why, like serious beer people would not like that, right ? Those people are assholes. I think that take might be accurate, though. What does house house ? An ipod ruined beer ? Because they're flavorful and they're good, and they're different than who would want that ? No, wait, you can't like i'm the snob now that if you hand me just a regular light beer, i don't want it. I want in i p s oh, it's ruined like if someone at a bar because like, hey, you want a beer ? No, give me an i p a so i've become that guy i had. I had never had an i p a and then i drank him for three months and then i was at an eagles game and i drank a domestic light beer and i thought there was something wrong with it. And i was like, well, miller miller lite taste like water to me now. Yeah, and miller lite is my my domestic light beer of choice. But the comparison between how heavy there it tastes way different. I didn't i think the take is accurate. Not exactly. I love thanks-man but i love i p a suit. But that's. Why ? I think it's act okay. By the way, i didn't wantto get too far past lebron thing before lebron taken the week that i don't know if we have to do with lebron taking the week we don't all nfl no, but this is too good from die hard lakers fan trey lebron now he still has value get us a superstar is going to play hard and close that games three straight games lebron let us down, it's the truth he did trey lebron, yeah, it's already it's already that all right ? So now let's, get to the nfl, the nfl it's about time the art-of-the-take it's, an all nfl addition of the artistic which thie art-of-the-take we know the nfl is is king for takes because there's segments dedicated on shows on monday called overreaction monday, right ? Which is basically just saying let's, overreact to what happened on sunday. We were talking last week in the n b, a edition about how the n b a is good for takes, but the n ba masquerades as like everyone thinks that they're smart and everyone tries to be understanding and the blah, blah, blah the nfl i feel like, is just sort of like no qualms about it being what it is, you know, here's, a sport where they did highlight videos of people getting hit as hard as they possibly. Connect up wth the nfl is his takes pretty much it's, like this sport version of takes. I think i agree. And i think the reason the nfl so great for takes is because it's so short, like every reaction you have, has to be over the top because there's on ly sixteen game right thing is kind of nuance and thinking about, like, long there's no long term in the nfl like guy loses one game like get him out, will you have to ? Because he if you wait too long, then he might win the next game and then he's the best player in the league and he missed an opportunity at it for an nfl takes are all the first thought that comes to your head ? Yes, tha first off their had tweeted out that there's there's the purest form of reaction of all the sports day and it's, the sport that every that the most people watch. So if you want to have a take that story like that's fishing and you know you're gonna catch something completely agree that's why sunday's orpik twittered is yes, there is no better day for takes in something and i do think as well, because fan bases have to stew on a win or a loss for a week that they are eminently troll a ble with takes i mean, they if if the lost feels bad on sunday, they have to think about the loss for an entire week, and what that does is it makes you overthink everything that happened. It really gets in your head and really sets it up for jj and the shelf life becomes greater for a take because you have to wait a whole week for the next game you want N.B.A. game, you could play back to back baseball. You play every day. Pa keys like basketball, like nfl take you through out there on a sunday or monday. That thing lives for seven days. It's true until the next game, which, like every other sport, doesn't have that. Alright, i tunes reviews of the week so it's, just some i gotta say, i truly enjoy waking up every morning opening up my laptop, going on, i searching art-of-the-take and looking at the review takes because they are they make my way. Yeah, so what you should do is if you're listening this podcast right now, either on apple podcasts are on your phone or on itunes, depending on how you listen, go and give the art-of-the-take one star or five stars for you five stars or one star is like a good take and leave your best take in the reviews. He could do that on apple podcast to scroll to the bottom, hit the stars, then leave the review or on itunes. We're up to one hundred seven ratings and i believe ninety one of them are five stars think ten of them are one star that's fine with me tube and unfortunately, we have six three star ratings not not approved. Listeners are not listening to the instructions of this pocket. No Gritty cleary tweak to this is not hard won star or five stars, preferably five stars, and leave your best take in the reviews. Okay, so the first one's from sean wrath and he said it was his first takes assuming this was the first take he's ever had in his life. Like we like, we talked about proud, this is that this was his first. They're really turning takes on turning people on to takes. Yes, i would say so. I think that's true. I've noticed an uptick in takes just around town. Yep. Everyone's got just around ten. I said i did i tell you ? My wife had to take the other day. She told me. Suraj alias trash ? What the hell ? What is it ? That even how could it take is what it is you take. You all told me. I don't have time to take for everything. And i said disagree. Wrong. You know what, though ? That's take from her. Yeah she's just she's learning she's going. Thanks. So his first take was if you claim that you like the book better than the movie. I do not trust your ability is a critical thinker. It is like saying that the painting is better than the photograph that portraying a subject. Wow, i mean so i think this is a good take for a lot of reasons. First of all, it it calls everyone who disagrees with you. Stupid. I do not trust your ability is a critical thinker. I think you're dumb second thing, it splits the audience. And half a lot of people at least have one example where they liked the book better than the movement. So it's going to anger everyone who's ever said that is calling them stupid and maybe a liar and snobby and yeah, and then it comes back around. We love the end of the take where he comes back around slaps in the face. He goes on, by the way, that's like saying the painting is better than the photograph of portraying a subject. Another thing that people go what ? Well, in a lot of ways, it is, but it isn't it's just a blurry version of the photograph. Yeah, i like that. If it flips the unusual narrative, he doesn't trust you as a critical thinker, but you would normally think the person that likes the book burst and he's the critical thinking, this is like, now don't move, you're actually done the book, i hear the dumb guy. He spent an hour grooming that i'm gonna watch it now and a half movie. Yeah, and know exactly what you just spent ten hours ahead. I don't have to think about what that guy looks like now i know, i know, i know you're wondering you're you're spending all this time and brain injured an energy painting yourself a visual picture of it. Where's i already no more snobby wine people or people that say that the book is but in the moon wine people, white people are the the dead worst because a you don't need to swirly it around, you don't need to smell it. And b it doesn't taste good. It's discussed let's be honest, i disagree on the second to you don't need to swirl it. Those people are not from from t a o tt commenter, which, of course, is the artistic mama better, which would be amazing if we got that going. Brad stevens will go down as a better college coach than N.B.A. can only coach boys can't leave men. The end is a scorcher could only lead boys, i love it. I always love a pro. I'll always love an anti brad stevens take now this isn't and this is like sort of a split the middle down and it angers a specific fan base, which i think makes it a great a great take. A swell yeah also kind of pisses off, but N.B.A. pee like college people on lee would be like yeah, there's also a feeling that there like that in your stomach, that this could be true. It's papa had an amazing short college career ridicule. He hasn't. He matched that india yet right to title games, right ? It wasn't saying from day well spent the subject little andrew short wow by take points right there Spike-Eskin i was convenient but got bored assumes that six years got good. Black coffee is only good if you're insecure and want to feel tougher than someone who likes milk or sugar the art-of-the-take a change that is in the review takes a shot at me. People love taking shots at me in the reviews, i would say one out of every four is a negative comment about me, so thank you, spike love patients when it was convenient and got bored assumes the sixties got good. I mean it's a good take. I don't think it might even be correct, not inaccurate. No, it is definitely not inaccurate. The coffee one is hard because, like black coffee, a lot of people say like it puts hair on your chest because that's what they told me growing up, it's disgusting! I didn't like off it's great. I drink bloodies water. You drink black coffee if you could just put sugar in it. Yeah, yeah, i know i could. I don't want to, but why ? It is actively tastes better. Why don't you want something that has nothing to do ? But maybe it does now i feel like i'm being sucked into this. I don't think i'm tougher than anyone for doing it mid. Maybe that's deep down what it is are you trying you trying to set example for luc ? Is that what this is ? My three year old son drink black coffee tougher. I drink it. So about a year ago, a little over a year ago, i gave up added sugar and artificial sweeteners, and i started to straighten your coffee black and every day i think i'm good because the smell of coffee is wonderful. Yes, the taste of black coffee is horrible, but if you've gotten used to it, walter, i'm used to a lot of things, but you don't like a lot of right, right ? Right, right. Drinking black coffee for, like a year and a half there and every day i'd be like, this is fine and then i put sugar in the raw on this and i was like, this is way better. Why did i subject myself to toe worst tasting things ? My only qualm with this it's okay, buddy. All nfl art-of-the-take it's in all from things in one take i get what he's doing here ? Yeah, ripping you, making me feel awful for drinking black coffee and then the art-of-the-take that i don't like the fact that three things together wow, he's not separate enough. He has to come right down on one. Take one. Yeah. Wow. You just don't want to be included. You wished he stopped at the spike. Take yes. In my opinion. The black coffee. Thanks. The only take in this in the tribune. Let's get to the take report card. Will that be nfl material in the take report card ? So it's actually all on lee nfl take report, guard ok in the all nfl version of the art-of-the-take. Okay, joe, i i feel like i'm going to give you the floor here because the first launch our report card is your tony romo is the same thing as carson wednesday go ahead. Carson wentz is so far in his career, the same thing is young tony romo, so i actually have an issue with joe here when i would like to bring up the take. So jo jo texted me early in the day, and obviously, you know, we have separate conversations about takes about the other per hers, and and he suggested that his carson wentz take might be sort of the end of you. I didn't want i didn't want to put jack on the group text for the carson wedding, which is totally fair, so i think those personally, you know, so joe was one of my favorite things, and he teases a take i love teasing takes i think it's always a winner, and early in the day he says, right, i'm trying to find it. Let me let me find your ah okay, here we go. Um, here we go. So the first tweet is, i decided which q b carson wentz, his career to date reminds me of, but i don't think the world is ready for this tape, and then later he says mobile really good stats. One big one team was loaded, fumbling issues, questions about fourth quarter comeback ability ? Carson wentz. His play is similar to a young tony romo. I gotta be honest, who had an opportunity in a scorcher you went in with sort of a warm take here's. What i would say is that if you wanted to, if you run in a true scorcher that take iss carson wentz is tony romo doesn't come through in the fourth quarter, not a waiter. That would have been the tape. I mean, that is the all times scorcher. I knew we had a podcast to record on thursday and i didn't want to burn this city down before that. I also thought about saying and i changed the wording at the end of total portion wants is nothing but yes. Ah, young tony romo's. Nothing but a young ten aroma is also the way to do that, because that really reminds people of the worst of tony romo's, right ? By saying it the way i did, i did. You have had a little bit because tony roma was a good player. Well, so here, here's. Why the idea for the take is brilliant, especially in Philadelphia. I will give you credit for that in that tony. Romo is way underrated and felon totally way under. It was a good player, a really good player if he had continued to play, i believe had a chance of being ah, hall of famer actually carson wentz, whatever he is, is certainly overrated in Philadelphia so you took a guy that is underrated Philadelphia and is a cowboy and compared it to a guy there's over eight and Philadelphia is currently golden boy. It was a brilliant way to to divide i understand not wanting to go all in on this one because it is, but but when i saw the execution of it, i was like, i understand why he did it that way, but nothing but a young tony romo would have really, really, really late. We wouldn't be recording right now city wouldn't exist. They would have been waiting outside W.I.P. with pitchforks. You did truly anger angelo cataldi. I told joe that angelo believes that joe exists specifically to annoy his takes that his cakes are specifically to dr angelo crazy, which i do enjoy a swell. Hi, andrew as well. The second one here is it's a whole book and it's a book with the title that is basically in and of itself a take and it's it's it's from merrill hodge who works for espn. Then his book is called brainwashed and it's basically calling basically calling ct ah complete sham and it is a plot he said it's brainwashed a plot to destroy football with bad science. So it is a very well when we talk about trump is a takes. Men were like go in and say something that everyone knows to be true say it's untrue and say that their line and that's what he did that's exactly what he did it for a full book, though, like that text that takes takes manship to a different love and brainwashed is so good because, like, everyone believes that seti is real because it is really, really because and now we're the crazy ones. Yeah, he flipped it around on us, will you ? Brainwashed where a bunch of zombies and the play on words they're brainwashed like there's like it's basically to spitting at the idea that ct exists is merrill hodge is tie, knot, take his giant taina. Yes, it's it's it's. Not a good take, but it's a it's. A fashion take it's definitely a fashion tape the the best part i think about the book coming out was the editorial reviews which down ? If you heard any of these from from trent dilfer, routing brainwash was an eye opening experience exposes the hidden agendas of play and bad science at work. Yeah, the bad science it feels. How does merrill hodge know if it's bad science way like the the audacity for merrill hodge, tv doofus and former football player to come in, who had concussion issues in his career ? Who comes out and goes ? I looked at all this science now, and i mean any out really handsome doctor with him and the doctor, just the breeding, the things he said, it was like, you're a real doctor like this isn't real state strikes me as someone came over. The idea for the book came tomorrow. Hodges, will you put your name to this and keep saying it out loud ? And he was like, yes, sure, somewhere to sign ? Yeah, i just i couldn't i couldn't get to know one thing as we wait talk about policy, we brought in the trump thing and we talked about takes your one thing that i hope my goal for this podcast is everyone gets to mad, it takes, they get too mad and i think that is part of why everyone is so divided in the country is because somebody has an opinion about something. And if you don't agree with it, you must hate that person and think the opposite. I don't want sports to divide us anymore. I want us to i want that the fact that we're able to come up with these takes if people can understand takes, maybe they won't get so mad. Plus it'll be boring if we all had the same take. Yes, like one guy said, when i when i did the lebron thing, they're a bunch of people that were mad that i said it. Why you mad ? Like, what is it ? Why you so mad at me ? Why did it change your day ? Yeah, like you don't need to think i'm an idiot in a clown because i didn't want lebron it's crazy it's just a basketball player, we don't even know him. You quit in the finals like what's. What are we talking about ? He couldn't play tight. End yes, zacharias is a better athlete, a even even i just don't think he'd be a better tight end. His actors like i just i hope it unifies us that's all i'm saying it's fair it's fair s o our favorite thanks-man Skip-Bayless has a new target. Yeah, and he unleashed this week. I don't have a video clip of it because it was on live tv. He did tweet it out, but is new take is that sake bomb ? Barclay isn't a generational running back he's on ly a home run hitter it's a great take, i think it it hearkens back to jack. You're a little young for this, but so if you remember, barry sanders takes it was basically barry sanders versus emmitt smith now forgetting about the fact that emmitt smith was on one of the best teams of all time with the greatest offensive line of all time, the pre salary cap error, which you can see all the great players have stayed with them all those years, and he could just run straight and it was fine. It does harken back to the barry sanders thing, and he knows that the giants are a bad team and they're going to be a bad team for a while and it's likely that they waste, say, quan barkley. So this is a wealth, a well planned take in that it's likely that he can just hold onto it forever. And we talk about this a lot account. Colin cowherd. He knows how to get to the city of philadelphia. Yeah, Skip-Bayless took a big fan base in a biggest city and went right into the divide that they've had since april because lot and didn't want to take, say, quan some of them did it's like, oh, no, right, but they all love seko on the right like they all agree he's one of us running, but some deep down, we're probably like we should've took a quarterback running back that's why he gets right at them i agree, it's just that i was watching it and i was sitting on my couch and i almost fell off my couch. I was like, kings kings just a king's. Yeah, safe on barclay. I know you think he's great. Just a home run hitter. Thing is, is it like and say quan barclay is one player ? I always i always say that football is, like, really difficult toe actually understand we can only think we understand it, but we don't know where anybody supposed to be like regular people don't say quan, barclays one player that you can watch tv and just be like, oh, well, that guy's way better than everybody everyone's trying to get him that everyone misses he's good every time and he's strong and he's fast and skip is just like me, man plus i love the plan words just a home run hitter home runs the best thing you could do, j just a home run hitter he's just barry bonds that's all he does should only be a single center that think back in my day s o our friend espn elliot short parks, eagles reporter there just are people that listen to this that aren't Philadelphia people. So i just wantto educate thank you for clearing that up. Short parks is it takes man wants to be on this podcast very badly. Some would say that some of his takes are designed to get him on the podcast. I would say that's, who do you think designs they're takes more to get the podcast, ben landon, then, then well, we set off just a fire less. I wasn't in on friday, and i heard it was like a dumpster fired. He called himself the ogi takes men. He was running around the hallways. Just screaming takes so it's hell wow. Last week, if you didn't listen the pod we gave afternoon show producer W.I.P. joe and i made him the number three takes men of the week for his that idea for his great pumpkin charlie brown. Take that is it's a piece of crap on dh that nobody should like runny eggs. And we call them the number three takes. Man, i was also on friday, but they've got that text that that ben was running around calling himself the ogi takes man. My wife asked me what i was laughing at. I had to explain it to her. But the great thing is, is we have, like i said to you guys, my goal, one of my goals for this pod was to make takes currency. And i think we did. And, like, i believe that we are the bank that distributes the currency and we gave ben take currency last week you've been spends rich now spends a lot of thes living thanks-man eso elliot comes out last week and says that jalen mills is actually the eagles best cornerback on dh it's, a classic take where everyone believes is one thing, okay, jalen moses, bad here's the actual truth, which is that he's, actually the best cornerback on the roster, infuriated a lot of people have gone on twitter is very angry colors were angry at him. It was it was a very well executed take and i found a way to piss off elliott the most because i said that that is a well actually takes man on and he did not like being called a well. So what does he want to be, then ? What is ellie ? I wonder what elliot is slash thinks she is is a thanks-man i think elliot is sort of like as a taste min it's sort of like like he's. Like a sugar rush takes men it's like that takes like he's. A volume takes man. He is a no fear takes men like he does not care what react. He unlike joe with his tongue and romantic ? Yes, he has. He has. He has a lot of traits of the all time greats, but maybe he's like a lebron takes men in that he has a lot of traits of all time greats. But maybe he has a serious deficiency and that maybe, well, actually is too much part of his repertoire. This feels like a well. Well, what he consistently does is that all of all filled up. He believes one thing, and then he just takes the takes the opposite opinion. But but he but what i will say is and this is also and it's also the sign of a well actually takes man, is that he will back it up. Yes, with if you're in an argument with him, i've heard him argue that jordan matthews and alshon jeffery thing ten times now was it like watching an artist paints a painting ? He wins the argument every time because he has enough information and he never gets that mad. And the other person always ends up cursing at him and saying, you know, if he i always say, if somebody curses at you or brings up the eye test, you have won. The argument so espn wins those and i believe that his jalen mills take was, well argued, but it is that is a well actually take yes, it is also with his takes, even if you think he's wrong there's sometimes there's something there, it makes you think, like, maybe he's, right ? Nigella mills is not very good. We i think everyone in Philadelphia knows this, but he does make a lot of plays in the red zone. He sometimes he makes a player like that was a really good play, he's really good in the red zone and that's all that gym shorts cares about right and really it's all that most fans ultimately care about because that's stopping point and his new is new thing is, yards don't matter which is pissing off a lot of people that's barter to barter is one thing that they're on the side seams out of, and what i will say, john does john marcher of that john barton, the goldbergs podcast what i will say as well is that what is not addressed here is that the eagles don't have any good cornerbacks, really so he's the best is not like is not that bold ? The statement, given that the team obviously believes that he's still good, because he keeps playing. Ronald darby gets burnt all the time, too. It's real enough ? Yes, that he could be right. Yeah. It's a good take. He might be a well, actually takes men, but it was a really solid take. This one came out today. It was from willie cologne and dave portnoy of barstool sports and talking about our favorite subjects. Carson went sir, or ah, or nick false. Here we go. I would've never started wins because of the injury. Just use think bp takeable champ from all the evp super bowl chemistry. I was delighted, in fact, that they altered the playbook specifically for him. You get winston who pretty much doesn't look like he's one hundred percent back from that. Is that maybe the the almost over a quarterback and the fact that i feel like you on lee put fulls. And if he's a situation where ? Like ryan fitzpatrick where he's stolen five picks a game like, aren't we ? We have no choice. We got to go to this guy. There was no rush to put wins back. Out there it was on ly because they set the future on him and they had to make right, so they threw him out there and all in all, honesty rest him too. You need um i mean it's a straight troll take. Yeah, well, especially important. Yeah. It's a straight troll take that. They're obviously coming after egos, fans it's a great take its well timed because right now, this is the this's. The first time that eagles fans have had any sort of doubt around carson went so it's really well time the fact that he says he's like not even healthy, turn your mic up like i know you can hear the same thing i can do is let the fact that comes out with we're not even sure we're not even sure he's healthy thing after he comes up for the thirty for thirty seven like his best passing day statistically of his entire career is as a interesting time to prophetic here's the take producing is actually Jack-Fritz is work. You're not lying. I take i know how to do it and just don't know if i'm great. Yeah, it's actually, that thing he is least good at is his job is my actual job. It's good. All right, this is so i don't know we're going to lose every week, but this this take was re service this week, and i do like giving some shout outs. Listen, throwback takes okay, and this is from terry bradshaw in twenty sixteen i've heard frozen cause about aaron, who i love and some of what i want. You've got to be kidding me. Really ? And and the and the car seat. The other hand. I've always said if i were going to get you ready for this, if i were going to get rid of one of the two, who would i get rid of ? You ready ? I get rid of rogers. I'm gonna keep a great coach. I think that guy is a great guy. I mean, that is it's insane. Do you think he believed it ? I don't know. Is there a little jealousy ? Because roger's better than terry bradshaw, way better than terry bradshaw. And i think so, my fair part of it. And i don't think it makes it a good tape, but just like i was amused by your ready. Yeah. Like, i'm going to do this right now yet maybe maybe he knew that he didn't believe it. Maybe that's. Why he pretended was on fox like sports. Yeah, so that makes sense. Is that maybe the euro we get him ? Get himself ready, jax not self conscious about his levels. I know how to prove. Yeah. I'm not really sure i'm gonna prove to you by the end of that. I know what i mean. What is the what are you producing ? I guess is the question well, the other day, the art-of-the-take alright can be the next one is my favorite segment of the week. I think everyone loves i think everyone loves the thirstiest take of the weak. So the james seltzer memorial thirsty estate is no longer with us. Yeah. J way ended james cells are no longer exist to us after his thirsty. Ajay. Ajay. I'ii take one wasn't going to take so the thirstiest take of the weak. And it actually wasn't even it wasn't. It wasn't a tweet. We had a search for this one from our from our good friend reuben frank. I was reading his article it's a good article that's. Good are good. Article. Reuben. Great eagle's reporter. Thorough, yet a great W.I.P. host as well. But but when you have a thirsty take ventured into thirsty. Now i do have an alternate take on this take, but please read it. Okay. This is from reuben frank. I ran two folds in the hallway of the nova care complex on thursday. We talked for a few minutes about his daughter, who is now sixteen months old. And then i headed into the parking lot. And it wasn't until i was walking towards my car to distract me that i was just talking to the super bowl mvp because foals acts about his un superstars. Possible he's the single most humble, unassuming, down to earth person i've ever met ever he's. Exactly the same now as he was when i was an unknown rookie backing up michael vick in twenty twelve. Here it comes. Every time i talk to falls, i feel just a little bit better about the world. Oh, my god. Those last two sentences. I mean, if you told me seltzer tweeted them, i would have not been shocked. Yeah, like that was that was thirst. That was please like my tweet, but here's, my alternate theory on this heat. So a thirsty tweet or thirsty take is is something that you're putting out there that you know is going to get mostly positive ? Ah, positive reinforcement you're going get like you're gonna get reading all this stuff this take, he knows because he always, like, will tweet out a nick full stat that makes nick foles look awesome and everybody's like, well, he's not that good, because i didn't say it was good, i just i'm just tweet love stat that's just that's. What happened ? It's ? Just a stat so he knows what the reaction would be. I think on its surface, this is thirsty, but i think it's sneaky like, like elbow in the ribs like like needle ing take i think, he's trying to needle people to there's no way he just truly believes that flatly. I think you did well to go off of what spike said there. This was at the bottom of his of his column. So this wasn't he didn't lead with this. This was like if you bothered to read the whole thing, you've heard every word of it. I i saw this. This was at the end. So maybe it is a needle in take us if he wanted to really get everyone like all look at the full stuff, he would've put up the top. This column it was at the bottom. And he also did like we did with our w N.B.A. take last week. We put at the end when he made everyone earn it. Yes, he did. Yeah, and he kind of ripped once this week a little bit. Well, he likes falls better. I know it is. I know he does. I'm just saying it was still thirsty, though, if you think it's an unquenchable nick foles. Third, i have a new take on this tape. Okay, there's, a lot going on here, do you think given the weak that went bad and giving whence is, like, desire to be mr charitable good person god fearing the dude that coming in and going by the way of all the people that i met it's, the super bowl mvp quarterback on the eagles who is everything that's good in the world. Everything that's good. No, not carson wants not car guy. That does it all. Right. Is it food trucks ? Yes. Is it ? Hey, i know you have your religion, food truck. But this guy with his daughter who hasn't changed even though he won the super bowl as m v p is this is it a secret shot at whence that's ? What ? I was thinking. I like it better than if it isthe sacred one set shot from reuben frank. Well, wow, take last thing from because i just can't leave this out. Fulls acts about his un superstar is possible, which is a great player words because nick foles is not a superstar, that is. You know what ? We went into this with one thing, and now i'm coming out with another like this. Should have been in the take report card. I think this is, you know, it's. It comes off his thirsty, but it is secret, not thirsty. So, congratulations. Room on the not thirsty it's takeable ? Yeah, the james salter memorial. Not thirsty, has taken the week. Are we doing the other one ? Yeah. So this so this is from our friend iraq ? Yeah, who is a fourth and john podcasts. And he is a passionate eagles fan. And he come out, comes out with his fixit video and lets just listen in. You know what i believe in winning ? That's. My new norm what's yours. So Philadelphia eagle's, next time you look at yourself in the mirror i want you to see two thousand seventeen staring you in the face. I want you to see a lombardi trophy staring you in the face. I want you to see a super bowl ring staring you in the face because this two thousand eighteen ship has gotta go. It's been a long time since i've had to say this what fixing the that is pure thirst, totally pure thirst. Pure thirsty. Please watch my video, please like it. But can we talk for a minute about the fact that he sounds like rocky and christian bale's, batman or not ? Christian and he also has, like he sort of sounds like you know how in movies they make Philadelphia people sound like they're from new york like you here, movie people are like, oh, no, no, we don't sound like that. We have a hoagie mouth we don't sound like you know we don't sound like a oh away but then there's iraq i is he from Philadelphia is he ? I don't know, i don't know he doesn't sound like he's from Philadelphia that's what i'm saying, but it comes off as he is, you know, like this eagles superhero fan who's going to come and beat up all the problems, right ? He's like like the youtube version of the shoulder pads guy on some level, like if if shoulder pads, guys, shawn also, i think the wording of the way he did it for starts take works because i think because the new enormous in there, which is a thing, you could use the new normal use it and the eagles were just bad two years ago like but i think it everyone's mind it's like they're the champs now we don't put up with this crap anymore. You we were putting up with this crap for fifty two years ago. They were good, i like, look, iraq is tremendous at what he does that is it is a i don't even know how people make those youtube videos with all the cuts in adam like it must take for it in my head, it takes forever. It is well orchestrated. Producer is gonna be very good at it. Definitely. I believe this should be the james seltzer memorial thirstiest take of the week. It was very thirsty. Yeah, yeah, i forgot to put us on the run down, but we have to get to our takes men off the week. Oh, shoot. You know, i forgot to write it down, but we should speed through this as this podcast going along because you fucked up the beginning. So back. I told you, i'm bad at producing. All right, who wants to start with there ? Takes one of the weak. I'll start. Yeah, i don't think i started last week. I don't think of starting number three back in the top box in my rankings is donald trump. Ah. So come back down it ? Yes. So you know, i discussed trump is it takes men. I think one of the best takes men in the country. Even if he's not, you know particularly good for the country. I think his his the puerto rico take about three thousand people didn't dive. Nineteen did. Is it just a take ? So this was what got him back into the rankings for may he's. Not lying ted cruz anymore. He's beautiful. Ted, i call them texas. Ted here is a guy who, during the primaries, he accused his father of being involved in the jfk murder and he's like, you know what, he's find out he's beautiful. He represents texas, texas ted so number three takes on the weakest trump number two is addie joseph of cbs sport it's now, i didn't think this was one of my takes great take until i realized how it made me feel. A lot of smart people and me are going to argue that paul millsap and al horford should be in consideration for the hall of fame when they retire in twenty twenty three or so, and a lot of other people are going to be very mad now. Initially, i thought this was a terrible take, but it made me angry. He called himself smart and me stupid, he like he backed it up with, like, he's sort of hedged in that he doesn't think that they're going to get in the hall of fame, but a lot of smart people are going to discuss it. Paul millsap in the hall of fame is pretty is like the smart guy version of Skip-Bayless so so number two and number one have Skip-Bayless you know lebron, mrs free throws to lose the fucking game Skip-Bayless came out swinging number one takes one of the week. All right, skip, is my number one's going ? We've talked about him and what he did my number two back in my top three colin cowherd for and i'm a believer in analytics in baseball, but he called the mantle itics love when he calls a mandolin, which is like, don't use them be a man like just let's man up and number three this week and making his debut from me in the top three. Doug peterson woe for after the game talking to the media about like, hey, if you guys want to watch eighteen hours of film, then you come at me. It was a come at me take. Yeah, you guys don't know what you're talking about. Ay dio, i'm doug peters. I never thought doug peterson was going to make our rankings. That thanks-man what ago skip a consummate takes man. Number three or number one. Number one. Number two. I still have francesa not only because now allies bad he's still defending you like yeah, and he was defending lie until he's put out to pasture. And also that he called the guy that said that his his apples only had three hundred people on it. Ah, fraud and a liar which i was like capital letters ? Yes. Which obviously makes it even better. And then entering into my takes one of the week is easily merrill hodge for his brainwashed wow! Brainwashed city is in real, but love it love it. Take review so we're looked back at the takes from last week from last week's takes a round table so just to fill you in if this is your first time, we give a non sports and leave a five or one star rating along with the review place we each giving nonsports take and then a sports take. And then we put a pole up on twitter and we let you vote on what the best take is jack's. Last week, waas was your parody one no, it was my it was my magic johnson is nothing more than a six nine mother carnival in yes, i think that's your best sports. Take so far mind was that allen iverson was thie number four best player in the nineteen, ninety three draft, and the sixers assured themselves not winning a championship when they took him and that joe joe actually has a revision to his take. Yes, you like you want to revise that joe's take last week was that the utah jazz were the only team in the western conference that could beat the golden state warriors. And my revision is that the boston celtics are nothing more than a bill simmons dup boston version of the utah jazz. Until they actually get a top ten player, they will not win a championship. Now that will not affect the results of last week where i want and had forty seven percent of the vote Spike-Eskin percent of the vote and joe, your weak ass jazz take had sixteen percent of wow, i do like anything that has nothing more than i do like your advise. And i think that might have even won if that had been. I agree it was it was a good revision. Wonder wonder of jack campaigning to win the pole had any effect on it. My campaign can use one of their own fair and honest results in my poles on twitter take a round table who's first aga first eyes this was this wasn't all nfl addition, right ? We're going back to that. We will only talk about the nfl bones i have are my this is my nfl take the week. We'll sit on the throne on sports first, right ? Okay. Non sports, not sports. Okay. Every generation has a clothing style that eventually goes out like you back in the day. Colonial dresses no one wore them from. Eventually people were suits to baseball games that stopped eventually. And i will call myself on the carpet on this one. Fifty, sixty years from now we will wonder why anyone ever wore denim. Why do we wear jeans ? Genes will be gone. I'm gonna take a year. Take. I think genes are uncomfortable. That's part of his take is like why are we wearing bed him all the time ? But i don't know. But who decided this ? We were down in the use to wear denim jackets. They're gone. I actually have a devil jacket. Well, that's what you want for long, wah jos, non sports takes of all the takes are the best takes. Why do we wear jeans ? I don't even wear them for one hundred years, but whatever, okay, i love it. Fifty years from now, we're gonna wonder why we weren't that always, when they see work pants, and then they became like, let's, just go out and have a beer on the wear jeans, why we're going to look at it like we look it like surgery in the nineteen tens. How did we ever do that ? They didn't sanitize their cigarettes. Yeah, that's, how we're going, blue cheese, put it aside, go. All right, sports. Take my sports. Take lombardi, walsh, bella checks. Shula, landry, hal iss brown and noll. Those are the on ly eight coaches. When it's all said and done, there will be more accomplished than the lock hall of famer andy reid. And it was ahead of the curve in passing over running in the late nineties. He's been way ahead of the curve in putting the college offense into the nfl. Now he gets the most at every quarterback and he has the best coaching tree of anyone ever, including bill walsh, one of the ten most significant coaches ever. Andy reid you're saying it's the top ten all time nfl coach ? Yes. Let me throw this. Take the anti too. That take or should i not do it ? I e se doing. I say do it now. Okay. I just think it fits this one. Yep. Andy reid is the lebron of nfl coaches. Get sick. Thank you, it's. Good. I like it. I like it a lot like a lot. Right ? All right. You wanna go ? Asher so here's, my non sports take. I was debating over a couple of them, but here's here's the one that i settle on. If something, how about this ? The theory of an acquired taste is bullshit. If you have to train yourself so like something, it means you don't like it, and you're just making yourself used to it. Black coffee, black coffee, red wine, tuna, fish. I love to get their stuff. I put mayonnaise and onions and celery, and you don't like it. Then. If you say something is an acquired taste, it actually just sucks. Here's, my sports steak. Nfl owners to save the sport and increase the quality of each team need to collude to keep top salaries of players down. I think collusion would help the nfl nfl players singularly individual nfl players. I really can't help their teams enough to justify top five salaries, so anybody earning a top five salary, any position aside from a few quarterbacks is actually actively hurting their team by preventing them from getting players at other positions. I see defensive lineman making all this money cornerbacks, wide receivers, running backs, they're usually on bad teams. I'd rather have a bunch of seven out of ten ts but there's no way they're going to be able to get a a collective bargaining agreement that says top players should make less money so they should collude. It's cheat ? Yes, they should lie illusion get collusion. Yes, i don't. I'm not in favor of the kaepernick and collusion, but to keep salaries down. I think it would be fine. Okay. Okay. So my non sports take is kind of just an overall twitter slash chauffeur may take the stick to sports. Crowd is right. Totally agree. It's a great take. I'm sorry, it's. A great take i i don't want to hear your political opinions, i don't really care. I just want i just want to read and be fun about sports when you follow somebody about sports it's for their sports takes it doesn't preclude them from having a political opinion, but like i just wish i have so many sports writers muted because they won't stick to sports and that's never Peter-Gammons yes, because he's a takes, i've amplified his twitter somehow like whatever the opposite of you is, what i did to get never goes well, when you do it or like when you watch people do it, you watch the response like they probably regret putting this out there. Yeah, that's a great take, i just i just don't like it and maybe it wasn't always true, but today i think it might be true and my sports take is that bill belichick, the defensive wizard, is dead ? He is not a good defensive mind. He's gotten torched over and over again. He's done nfl defenses all aren't all good anymore and belichick is nothing special anymore. Bill belichick nothing special andy reid top ten coach ever bill belt that that's, why they are still a good overall personnel. Alright, i'm just talking about defense allowed on hedge, i'm hedging. Take, yeah, about bill belichick socks. She would talk about work twitter with the with the p i forgot, i forgot to put it on their thing. Now we don't need to double down on our last podcast. We could just save it. We'll bring it up some other time. Sounds good. Ah, the artistic art-of-the-take leave us one star or five stars and your best take in the apple podcaster itunes around. We'll read them next week in order to take the art-of-the-take.
